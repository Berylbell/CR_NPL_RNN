Part I Edit 
 MATT: And welcome back.
 TRAVIS: That was a new level.
 MATT: We’ve definitely returned to the table. Thank you, Sam. So.
 MARISHA: Wait, super fast. We’ve got to go through credits. Right? Okay. So normally we don’t do this, and I did this once before when we released our other opening title sequence. Yeah, 50th. So we’re going to do this again. These are just people who do so much and who do not get enough love. I’m going to shout them out. Sean Becker, who’s the unsung hero of Geek and Sundry, he’s the executive producer. T.J. Rotell, he’s our production manager around here, he makes sure that we actually have cameras. Maxwell James, our producer that makes this show go every week. Dani Carr, our production coordinator, also huge producer here. Steve Sprinkles, who directed that amazing opening title sequence.
 SAM: That’s not a real name!
 MARISHA: I know. I love it on the slate. It always says 'Sprinkles’. Jan-Michael Losada, who is our D.P., and is the same D.P. from last time. Tristan Savage-Tate, our first A.C. Sean Delahunt, who is our key grip. Tyler Hart, who is our gaffer, who gaffs everything around here, he’s amazing. Jenny Newman, who did the amazing wardrobe. She sourced all the wardrobe. Wren Witting, who’s one of our hair and makeup artists. Vanessa Marie, who is our second hair and makeup artist. Jose Sosa, who was our production assistant. Selina Ruthe–
 LAURA: That’s a lot of pieces of paper!
 MARISHA: I know. Selina Ruthe, who did additional photography, and she also does stuff every day.
 LAURA: Why didn’t you put them on the same piece of paper?
 MARISHA: Because I didn’t know there was going to be this many. Brandon Clark, who was our location manager. Pamela Joy, who shot all the photos for that, and Loretta Ritchert.
 LAURA: Yeah, they’re with Heirloom Photography, and they did all of our thumbnails, too. They did that poster.
 ASHLEY: Go check them out on Instagram!
 MARISHA: Jason Charles Miller, who does our music.
 LIAM: Party on, Garthok!
 MARISHA: Sean Hudson, who does our post-production. And Andy Inglat, who edited thatthing. Okay. I’m sweating a lot.
 MATT: That’s okay. So.
 SAM: What a night. Well, guys…
 TALIESIN: This has been great.
 LIAM: Holy shit.
 MATT: Everyone. Everyone.
 SAM: Can we open our fricking books yet?
 MARISHA: Not yet.
 MATT: Welcome to Wildemount. The year is 835 P.D., or post-Divergence. This continent is divided both by jagged terrain and political powers. The Menagerie Coast, a collection of city-states united under the Clovis Concord, monopolizes the southwestern shores and ports of Wildemount, thriving on open trade and cultural freedom. Beyond the Cyrios Mountains lies the massive region known as Wynandir, bisected by the Ashkeeper Peaks. Eastern Wynandir houses the expansive wastes and turbulent badlands of Xhorhas, overrun with all manner of beasts and terrors, relics from the final battles of the Calamity that ruined that scarred landscape. Northward, you would find the Greying Wildlands, a lawless realm harboring a curse that has kept it unconquered by human hands. However, this story begins in the territory of Western Wynandir, within the boundaries of the Dwendalian Empire. Emerging 13 generations before, the Dwendalian Empire has slowly spread to encompass the surrounding societies of the region, absorbing the peoples of the Zemni Fields and the Marrow Valley, before finally conquering the Julous Dominion and taking the whole of Western Wynandir for the Empire.
 SAM: There will be no test.
 MATT: No. This is– let me continue. Under the rule of the current King Bertrand Dwendal, now in his 68th year, most are left to their own devices. You live as you did before. The crown only takes a tithe of what you produce and earn. You follow its laws, worship its gods, and bow to its installed local leadership. In return, denizens of the Empire are protected from the chaotic horrors and shadowed evils that stalk the edges of the civilized lands. This accord has led to a prosperous century for the Empire, or at least the political elite. Tensions brew beneath the chafing watch of the Crown’s Guard. Every temple is government-owned and run, and worship outside the approved idolatry is met with imprisonment. Rumors of military clashes at the eastern border near Xhorhas have many common folk on edge. Our story, however, begins much smaller. Here in the southern reaches of the Marrow Valley, beyond the entry gates of the Wuyun Gorge, lies the small rural town of Trostenwald. Bordering the blue waters of the Ustaloch, this town came to prominence near the turn of this recent century, when the surrounding fertile farmlands were discovered to produce a unique type of grain and wheat, leading to a boom of breweries. When the glut subsided, three large families stood triumphant in the local business of fermented delights. Now Trostenwald thrives on their exports of fish, crops, and ale. Here in this sleepy trade stop along the Amber Road, a handful of wandering destinies slowly begin to intersect. 
We begin in the early hours of the morning on the day of Grissen in a messy room on the second floor of the Nestled Nook Inn. A bleary-eyed, bruised man in a tattered coat slowly wakens from his lengthy sleep, catching his small, snoring ally curled at the foot of the bed. Liam, if you would like to describe your character, please.
 (nervous laughter)
 LAURA: Oh my god, no pressure!
 SAM: Were we supposed to prepare this?
 LIAM: I’m pretty filthy. I have a mess of reddish-brown hair, and really filthy road clothes. I wear a long coat that I slept in. I slept about 20 hours last night. Jeez. Unshaven, a bit of a mess.
 SAM: So far you’re just talking about current Liam.
 LAURA: What color are your eyes? I need visual.
 LIAM: They’re blue. That’s it. It was a rough day yesterday, and– that’s it.
 MATT: And your name is?
 LIAM: Oh. Caleb. Caleb Widogast.
 MATT: All right. As your smaller friend curls awake, Sam, would you like to describe your character?
 SAM: Yeah. Um. I am a little goblin girl.
 (laughter)
 SAM: I am a goblin. So, you know, the green skin, the green hair, the yellow eyes. And she wears not-great clothes, just like her traveling companion there. She hides in the shadows a lot, because she knows goblins aren’t welcome in this part, and that’s about it. I mean, she’s a little skittish, and right now she’s probably stirring awake as well, right?
 MATT: Well. What’s your name?
 SAM: Oh. Nott the Brave.
 MATT: So Caleb, as you come to consciousness, you glance over and can see, slowly snoring and rousing at about the same time, Nott’s eyes blink open, her slowly groaning face looking over towards you.
 SAM: (high-pitched Cockney accent) Oh! You’re finally awake, I see. Oh yeah, motherfuckers. It’s on. You were out for quite some time, there. Rough day, eh?
 LIAM: (light German accent) Not our best day, no.
 SAM: No, I mean, usually you’re so good at everything, but yesterday you were just– maybe you needed the sleep, is what you needed.
 LIAM: Thank you.
 SAM: Well, don’t thank me yet. I should probably tell you what happened while you were asleep. I mean, you were asleep for so long. I got bored, frankly. I was going through my pack and reorganizing.
 LIAM: Has anybody seen you– seen you seen you?
 SAM: Well, I mean, many people? I got bored. You’ve never slept that long, so I left, I went downstairs, I thought I’d do a bit of window-shopping, and you know how sometimes I get the itch, you know?
 LIAM: I do. Did you make it back here okay, at night?
 SAM: I’m here, aren’t I?
 LIAM: Yeah, you are.
 SAM: Yeah, I did. But I might have been spotted by a few of the Crown’s Guard.
 LIAM: Did you have the mask on?
 SAM: No? No, I didn’t. But they didn’t catch me, so. Listen, I’m sorry, sometimes I get the urge, I’ve got to take something, you know? I was trying to replenish what you lost yesterday, and I failed.
 LIAM: Well, we– (sighs)– discussed coming to a bigger town. It’s going to be a little more difficult now. You can’t go– it was easier on outskirts, it was easier in farms, but we can’t do that here.
 SAM: I know, I’m sorry. Yeah. I know. You’re right. Yep. I just got a little bit squiggly. That’s all.
 LIAM: Okay. Well, I think today you should have the mask on at all times.
 SAM: Yeah, good idea, Caleb.
 LIAM: It’s better when we’re working together. If you need to steal something, do it with my help,
all right?
 SAM: Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah.
 LIAM: Back up the conversation a minute. Thank you. I would not be alive if you had not– you saved my life. So thank you.
 SAM: Ah, no problem.
 LIAM: Yesterday was really not great.
 SAM: Yeah, well, we’ll do better today, right?
 LIAM: Sure. Sure we will. Are you hungry?
 SAM: Yeah, I’m starving.
 MATT: At this point, you notice the gentle smell of cooked meats and promises of mediocre porridge and eggs just barely begins to creep beneath the subtle floor of your room, meet your nostrils.
 LIAM: Well, Nott, what are we going to do today? I can go down and get breakfast and bring it up here. At least– I don’t know. I mean, I’m a little wary of just splashing back into the town right away.
 SAM: Let’s go down, get some food. I’ll come with you, 'cause as you said, we’re better together. And we’ll take it from there. You need some books and stuff, right?
 LIAM: Always.
 SAM: All right, well, that’s on the to-do list.
 LIAM: All right, well, let’s get something to eat, then.
 MATT: All right, so you prepare yourself with your mask set over?
 SAM: Yes, yeah, so I have a half a mask that covers my goblin face, and with the hood over, kind of obscures. Maybe it’s not a goblin, maybe it’s a little halfling person or something.
 MATT: Which is helpful. The southern, more rural region of the Empire, especially near Felderwin, which is one of the largest tilling and farming areas of the entire Empire, has a very heavy halfling population. And so while this city is not the core of it, you’d probably see a larger 20-25% of the population here in Trostenwald is halfling. So you pass off pretty decently as long as you keep away from discerning, intent eyes. So the two of you manage to gather your things for the time being, wander down the stairs from the top floor down to the base of the tavern, which, the air is already bustling with townsfolk and all manner of travelers preparing to take on the day’s responsibilities. Yorda, the 40-something woman barkeep with shoulder-length blonde hair and weathered skin that you previously rented your room at the inn from, frantically darts behind the bar while the red-headed barmaid rushes from table to table. It seems that the clientele is a bit more than they were expecting this morning. Yorda yells from behind the bar to the barkeep, “Adelaine, two more brats and a bit of mush at the corner table.” She looks up, “I’m working on it!” And she runs over and heads back to the kitchen. There’s a faint bit of music as two slovenly-looking musicians in the corner are trying to work for tips with a small hat on the floor that it looks like nobody’s thrown any coin into it. The tables are fairly busy, except for maybe two that appear to be available between the two of you guys, if you’d like to find a seat.
 LIAM: Okay. Sure. Is that easy to do, find a seat?
 MATT: Yeah, you walk over to it, you sit down.
 (laughter)
 LIAM: Is this how DandD works?
 SAM: What do we roll for?
 (laughter)
 MATT: You sit down, and due to the chaos that ensues around you, it takes a little while for Adelaine, the red-headed barmaid, to come by, and she scoots by the table. “I’m terribly sorry. What can I get you?”
 SAM: You know, meat if you have it, but if you don’t, that’s okay, too. Potatoes, or bacon if it’s on the menu, but really anything–
 MATT: “I can get you all three, it’s fine. What you want?”
 LIAM: A Trost for each of us, please.
 MATT: “For breakfast? I like you. All right, two Trosts and a bunch of meats. Be right back.” And she rushes off, she pulls her hair back and ties it as she goes into the kitchen, getting ready for the midst of chaos. While you guys have a moment there at the table, you can hear conversation muttering around you, and you have a brief bit of privacy to discuss.
 LIAM: Yes, I need books, that’s true, but did you find drink yesterday?
 SAM: I have a little left in my flask.
 LIAM: How much?
 SAM: Just a couple swigs.
 LIAM: So that’s also on the to-do list, then.
 SAM: I mean, if you don’t want me to get too jittery, yeah.
 LIAM: All right. Okay. So we’ll do that first.
 SAM: All right.
 TRAVIS: I love her.
 (laughter)
 MATT: A short time passes before the two platters are rushed over and scattered across the front of your table with a clattering. Pile of meats there set for you, a little bit placed on the side, because you might need, especially with the look on your face– Adelaine gives you a glance and goes, “Put something in your belly.” Comes back and slides two Trosts to you.
 SAM: I remove my little mask, and then just go (eating noises).
 (laughter)
 LIAM: I take the last piece.
 MATT: As you guys are partway through your meal– let’s see, this would be Caleb. You notice out of the corner of your eye a gentleman enter the door looking kind of meek. Middle-age, looks work-hardened. He has a heavy chin-beard that is unkempt and a bit wild, but his eyes are warm. He’s holding his hat in his grip, and he scans the room with an eager glance before his face brightens, and he begins to push his way across the room, in your direction, it looks like. He scoots over towards your table, and as you’re about to turn and see what he’s about–
 LIAM: I’m putting my hand on my purse.
 MATT: –he pivots to the table next to you instead. He turns to you three.
 (yelps)
 LAURA: We’ve just been sitting here this whole time!
 MATT: Yeah. You’ve met this man the day before, Rinaldo, the fisherman, who you had aided. And as he approaches, he goes, “Might I sit, please?”
 LAURA: Of course, take a seat.
 SAM: What’s that?
 MATT: As he sits down in his chair, I would ask each of you to please describe yourselves, starting with you, Laura.
 LAURA: (Slavic accent) Oh, well, okay. I’m just, you know, a little blue tiefling, that’s all, with blue hair. And I’m wearing a pretty cute dress, that’s all. And I’m having a good time, you know? We’re just having a good time here at breakfast.
 MATT: All right. And you?
 MARISHA: Uh, yeah. Yeah. I’m, you know, simple girl, simple needs. Just wearing nice, baggy clothes, some monk vestiges. They’re in nice blues and greys. You notice I have a blue sash around my belt. Got a nice shave going on, little undercut. Looks like maybe I put on makeup two days ago, and I’m like, yeah, it’s still holding up. It’s fine. I can work with that.
 SAM: What’s your name?
 MATT: We’ll get to that. Thank you. And Travis, if you’d like to describe yourself, please?
 TRAVIS: (Texan drawl) Yeah, I’m here too.
 (laughter)
 TRAVIS: I’m a half-orc, sitting here in beat-up leathers. Have a big scar across my face.
 SAM: (sings 'Bad to the Bone’)
 (laughter)
 TRAVIS: Green skin tone, and got some piecemeal armor put together and stuff. My name’s Fjord.
 LAURA: You’re very handsome. I just need to tell you.
 TRAVIS: Thank you. Appreciate that.
 MATT: As Rinaldo sits down, clutching his hat still in his hands, says, “I thank you for your time. Fjord. And, I apologize, I forget your names.”
 MARISHA: Beauregard.
 MATT: “Beauregard. And?”
 LAURA: Jester.
 MATT: “Jester, thank you. You all came when no one else would yesterday, and because of you my daughter is still alive.”
 MARISHA: Oh yeah. Sorry for being a pessimistic asshole, by the way, when we first came into town.
 MATT: “Oh, that’s okay.”
 MARISHA: I’m not used to things turning out good.
 MATT: “You’ll do well this side of the Empire. Anyway. I won’t keep you, but I– we spoke yesterday, and I didn’t have much to give you. Sent you away with nothing but my gratitude. But I’ve been asking around the other fishermen, lochsmen, and we’ve put together a little bit of coin for your troubles, so.” And he turns his cap over on the table, and this catches your attention, you hear this clattering of coin. Your eyes glance over, especially you, Nott, and watch as he leaves this pile of what looks to be mostly copper and silver pieces, with a couple of glimmers of gold, and as soon as it clatters across the hard wood table here in the center of the tavern, other faces begin to turn, gather attention as to what’s happening over here in the back edge, and he takes his cap back and pushes it forward towards all of you, his dirty, you can see cracked and very callused fingers shoving it in your direction, before taking his hat and placing it back over his head.
 LAURA: So cool!
 LIAM: Those coins went all over the floor?
 MATT: All over the table. “I hope it’s helpful. But thank you.”
 MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. Oh wait.
 TRAVIS: We can’t accept this, right? I mean, it’s too much.
 MARISHA: We’re supposed to at least say that,right? And then still accept it, right?
 TRAVIS: I think you’re supposed to do it if you say it.
 LAURA: Well, I mean, he did go around to a bunch of people. That was a lot of work on his part. I would hate to make him go back to all of those people and give it back to each individual person.
 TRAVIS: Fine, fine.
 MARISHA: If he didn’t keep a ledger, you know. We wouldn’t want to do that. It’s rude not to accept a gift, right? It’s rude not to accept a gift, right?
 MATT: “I would hope that is the case. Anyway. Thank you very much. I am sorry for getting in your way.” And he stands up and gives you all a nod and rushes out of the tavern, a little embarrassed by all the attention that’s now placed on him by the other patrons, and as he leaves, everyone goes back to their business, a couple of wandering eyes starting to count what coins are there as you slowly mitt them in your direction.
 LAURA: Divide it up.
 MARISHA: Okay, okay.
 MATT: There are four gold pieces amongst the pile, 22 silver, and 48 copper pieces.
 TRAVIS: Can I clock the room, see who else is watching her count?
 MATT: Perception check. 48 copper.
 TRAVIS: Is this the first roll?
 MATT: First roll of the campaign.
 TRAVIS: Natural 20.
 (cheering)
 MATT: And that’s how you start it. All right.
 LAURA: So I’m leaving it to you to do that counting. Which is really hard for me, personally, but there you go.
 MARISHA: How do you split up four gold? We have four gold and there’s only three of us.
 LAURA: Don’t know.
 TRAVIS: Well, I actually did pretty good at that card game, so you can have mine.
 MARISHA: Aw. I will. Okay.
 LAURA: So two for each of us! That’s great.
 MARISHA: Oh, that’s good. One for you, two for me, two for– oh wait, no, wait, math doesn’t make sense.
 SAM: She’s your treasurer?
 MATT: This is going to go great.
 LAURA: It’s hard not being the treasurer.
 MARISHA: I’ll give two to Jester, one for you, one for me. And then 22 silver, that’s–
 LAURA: Tell you what, you do that math.
 MATT: While you’re counting this out and figuring out the division of your gains, Fjord, you glance about, narrowing your orcish eyes across the room, and you can see two other tables there are some gentlemen who are peering over, and as soon as they meet your gaze, they go right back to their business and completely shrink away. There’s a man and a hooded figure at a table immediately adjacent to you. The man looks rather filthy, his hair a bit unkempt, and he’s trying to finish his drink. However, the smaller halfling-looking figure is just glaring intently, and is slowly leaning in the direction of the table.
 TRAVIS: That’s creepy. Fucking disgusting. I think we have people watching us.
 LAURA: Who is watching us?
 TRAVIS: Well, just take a look right over there.
 SAM: Don’t arouse suspicion, but did you hear all that coin hit that table, Caleb?
 LIAM: I did. It’s on the table, though, so I think on the table it will stay.
 SAM: Yes, but we could follow them out. We could do the Moneypot. We could run Rat Food. We could do Prince and the Pauper to get it from them. We could try Spider Eyes. Any of those could work–
 LAURA: Are you guys staying here?
 MATT: This blue-skinned tiefling suddenly leans over to you at the table.
 SAM: Don’t move. Don’t move. Tieflings can only see movement.
 LIAM: I don’t think that’s true–
 LAURA: It’s very true, we have a hard time seeing things that aren’t moving, it’s very true. But I can hear you. You should take a bath. You know they have showers here. It’s possible.
 LIAM: A what now?
 LAURA: You bathe yourself in water.
 LIAM: No, I’ve bathed before, yeah, I know what a bath is.
 LAURA: It’s because you smell really bad, and it’s wafting over this direction. I’m just letting you know. I would hate if I smelled that bad and someone didn’t tell me.
 LIAM: I’ve only just met you.
 LAURA: Hi! I’m Jester.
 LIAM: Hi, I’m Caleb.
 LAURA: Nice to meet you, Caleb. How much silver did I just get?
 MARISHA: Seven!
 LAURA: Woo!
 (laughter)
 MARISHA: And 16 copper. Aren’t you all jealous?
 SAM: Morning.
 MARISHA: Morning.
 MATT: Make a perception check, Beauregard and Jester.
 LAURA: Whoa.
 LIAM: Are you checking your DnD Beyond specs?
 MARISHA: I am, I’m adding my–
 LAURA: 22. I haven’t even flipped over my character sheet yet. This is crazy.
 MARISHA: 19.
 MATT: Okay. The somewhat meek female halfling who’s now suddenly very reserved, and not as filthy as the human compatriot that she keeps, seems less and less halfling the more you glance in her direction. The ears are folded inward but elongated, the tinges of green to the skin, and with the little words that have poked through her lips, you can see what appear to be teeth more jagged than expected of the half-folk.
 MARISHA: I just shout over and I say, good morning, in Halfling.
 SAM: I know Halfling, right? Yes. I’ll shout back, top of the morning to you.
 (laughter)
 MARISHA: Would you like a coffee? I’d love to buy you a coffee.
 SAM: We’ve got– free coffee? Yeah, yeah, I’ll take it. Sure. Thank you.
 TRAVIS: You’re being mighty fucking friendly. They were looking at our coin.
 MARISHA: Why can’t they have been looking at me? Maybe they were looking at me.
 TRAVIS: I didn’t think of that.
 MARISHA: Maybe they were looking at you. As Jester said, you’re handsome.
 LIAM: Just–
 LAURA: Yes?
 LIAM: Nott.
 SAM: He said “Jest”.
 LAURA: I just thought you said my name, is all.
 MARISHA: Oh, I said your name. Oh, they might have said your name, too.
 LIAM: Never mind, never mind. Could I get another Trost over here, please?
 SAM: Two, please, right away.
 MATT: Eventually Adelaine comes by and brings two fresh Trosts to the table, glancing about at the unique tension in the air right here. “Would you like anything as well?”
 LAURA: Oh, yes. Lots of baked goods if you have them, please.
 TRAVIS: Pork belly, if you have it.
 MARISHA: I don’t think I’ve seen you eat anything other than pastries.
 LAURA: I really like them.
 MARISHA: I’m kind of concerned for your well-being. It’s fine, I’m not that concerned. Eat whatever you want. I’ll have bacon, some ham, whatever.
 MATT: “All right, pork it is. I’ll be right back.” She rushes off to the kitchen. You guys continue to awkwardly stare at each other.
 LIAM: I’m going to put my hand up and say, quietly, to Nott, the Moneypot is not for them. It’s not for them, it’s for farmers. Okay?
 SAM: Yeah, you’re right, you’re right.
 MARISHA: Do we notice them whispering?
 MATT: With your perception rolls earlier? Yes.
 LIAM: But I said it really quietly.
 (laughter)
 MATT: She rolled a 22.
 LIAM: But she can hear my little whisper?
 MATT: No, you heard the whisper, you’re not sure what the words are. You can see that they’re whispering. Being mysterious.
 LAURA: Okay, cool.
 SAM: In Halfling, I’ll say to Beau–
 MARISHA: Beau for short works.
 SAM: Are you in town for business or pleasure?
 MARISHA: Can I insight check him, see what he’s hiding?
 MATT: Make an insight check.
 MARISHA: Okay. What’s my insight, I can’t remember.
 LAURA: What is he saying? I mean you, you’re a girl. What is she saying? Shit. That’s really hard to remember now.
 SAM: You’re asking me what I’m saying.
 LAURA: Yeah, what did you just say?
 MARISHA: 13.
 MATT: 13? I mean, seems to be genuine. Hard to read through all the wrappings, shadow, and the hood still obscuring the face.
 LAURA: Do you have the mask covering you?
 SAM: I think I do.
 MATT: Yeah, it’s this porcelain covering that has painted lips. It’s a little unsettling.
 LIAM: I mean, I’m sorry, not to be blunt, but, you know. It’s pretty obvious goblins are not welcome strolling about.
 LAURA: She’s a goblin?!
 SAM: Yeah, yeah, but you don’t have to make a big thing of it, all right? There could be people here who don’t know.
 LIAM: That’s right. She’s my companion, she’s my friend. There’s nothing to make a big deal about. That’s why she’s wrapped up. Just leave it, please.
 LAURA: I didn’t ask why she was wrapped up.
 MARISHA: I know, we’re not making a big deal out it. You’re making a big deal out of it.
 LIAM: Somebody asked why she was wrapped up.
 LAURA: No, nobody asked.
 LIAM: Somebody said the words– this is Liam– “Why are you all wrapped up?”
 MARISHA: Oh, I asked if she was cold.
 (laughter)
 SAM: That’s concern.
 MATT: As Caleb finishes oversharing.
 LIAM: Vaxleth is over. It’s so over!
 MARISHA: Those are old times, man. That was a different universe. Different life.
 MATT: At this point, there is a bit of a commotion towards the entrance of the tavern. Two shadows step into the doorway of the nearish-noonday sun. The figures, one eclipsing the other from behind, begin to step in. You notice one of them begins to step from table to table, glancing about with a sort of grace to the movement, the other staying a few feet behind. Taliesin, if you’d like to describe your character, please.
 LAURA: I didn’t think we were going to meet you so soon!
 TALIESIN: Neither did I.
 ASHLEY: I didn’t either.
 TALIESIN: But here we are. A lavender– damn it, Travis. A lavender tiefling with red eyes and very pierced, extremely ostentatious horns that are pierced with little gems and little baubles. He’s got a tattoo that seems to be running up the side of his face, a peacock tattoo that goes off into his very ostentatious, ridiculous, overblown robes that he wears. His two swords and pouch dangling at the side of his hips. He’s very broad in his dress.
 LIAM: So a literal and figurative peacock.
 TALIESIN: Oh yes.
 TRAVIS: One of your characters? No.
 TALIESIN: I know, mine. Who knew?
 MATT: As this tiefling darts from table to table, a few feet behind, you see–
 ASHLEY: Wait, did you say your name?
 TALIESIN: I didn’t say my name.
 ASHLEY: Okay. So there is a woman behind him. Taller than your average… lass.
 (laughter)
 ASHLEY: She’s very, very, very pale-skinned. Her hair is black that starts to turn white as it gets longer. It’s matted, it’s dreaded, it’s braided. Her clothes are a bit tattered, but just sort of– she’s a bit of a mess, and she has two different color eyes. One of them is a light greenish-blue, and the other is a violet color. And she’s very standoffish, hunch-y, arms folded.
 MATT: You watch as these figures slowly move from table to table, the tiefling engaging in some distant conversation, leaving a slip of paper, walking to the next table. Gauging the atmosphere, not leaving a slip of paper, and quickly moving on, and then eventually your eyes meet what looks to be two tables with a very motley crew of individuals that are both awkwardly avoiding their own tension and currently trying to figure you out.
 TALIESIN: Can I tell if– where are they in the dispensement of the coin? Can I tell they have a little coin on them? Did I catch any of that?
 MATT: They’ve completed distributing, so you don’t see any coin, unfortunately.
 TALIESIN: Well. I don’t believe I’ve ever seen a group of people more in need of a good time in my entire life. Mollymauk Tealeaf of the Fletching and Moondrop Traveling Carnival of Curiosities. If there was ever a group of people that needed a good time to go out, have a laugh, see things that you have never seen before, and my god, take my word for it, one month’s time, people will be buying your ale to hear the tale of what you saw at the Traveling Carnival of Curiosities this night.
 LAURA: We saw your tent going up! We did!
 MARISHA: We were actually going to go without the flyer, but now we also have a flyer.
 TALIESIN: It’s just five copper. A steal. At five silver, it would be a steal, at five gold? Worth every penny. But if you’ve got the five copper to spend, we would happily have you all.
 LAURA: Do you perform?
 TALIESIN: Ah. I’m less of a performer and more of an intermediary for these parts. I do on occasion
perform. I can read fortunes–
 LAURA: (gasps) I was going to ask if you read fortunes! Can you do one now?
 TALIESIN: I knew you were going to ask that.
 LAURA: (gasps) Oh my gosh, you’re so smart. Look at this guy, he knows everything!
 TALIESIN: I’m going to sit down at the table.
 MATT: Okay. He goes and sits down at this table, finishing his presentation. One of the barmaids comes up to you, and looks up. You’re standing almost a solid seven inches taller than her. “Miss, can I get you a drink?”
 ASHLEY: (deadpan) Yes could I have a drink, please. Just some ale.
 MATT: “Coming right up. Any preferences for the family? Baumbauch?”
 LAURA: Stay clear of Baumbauch. They’re dicks.
 MARISHA: That’s kind of true.
 ASHLEY: Just a big.
 MATT: “Husseldorf, then. All right. Be right back.” And she wanders off.
 TALIESIN: Well. Who has coin for a fortune?
 LAURA: Do you know my name?
 TALIESIN: What is your name?
 LAURA: Jester.
 TALIESIN: I know your name now!
 LAURA and TALIESIN: (laugh)
 LAURA: What is your name?
 TALIESIN: Oh, my name is Molly to my friends, and we’re friends, now, aren’t we? Pleasure.
 LAURA: Molly. Look at this guy.
 TALIESIN: Mollymauk. Molly for short. This is Yasha, she’s a charm.
 ASHLEY: Hello.
 MARISHA: Yasha. Yasha.
 TALIESIN: Now. Would anyone like a fortune read?
 LAURA: I would love one.
 TALIESIN: Do you have coin?
 LAURA: Yes. How much do you want?
 TALIESIN: Two copper.
 LAURA: Two copper, okay, I just got some copper. Here you go.
 MATT: Mark down your two copper. (laughs)
 TALIESIN: I am taking this in. All right. (sighs) I’m going to try and do this.
 LAURA: Oh my gosh, really?
 MATT: So, as he pulls out a small set of cards and begins to shuffle them, go ahead and roll an insight check.
 ASHLEY: (deadpan) He’s really quite good, you all should line up and get your fortunes told.
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: Let’s do a 16 there.
 MATT: Okay, so you get a brief conversation here, you get a pretty solid read: the excitability, the eagerness, and the exuberant interest in just getting in your face that this person wants– any fortune you tell will probably suffice. Go ahead and roll a sleight-of-hand check as well.
 SAM: Look at this fucking game!
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: Also 16.
 MATT: Yeah. And you feel pretty confident that her eyes are locked onto your eyes at the moment and not the deck, as you set up a proper reading. And the cards are shuffled, set, you place them before you, and you may give your fortune.
 SAM: I’m going to just keep my eyes open for any tricks of the hand, sleight-of-hand-y-type tricks.
 MATT: Make a perception check.
 SAM: Okay. Perception. 14.
 MATT: 14. All right. Everything seems pretty above-board.
 TALIESIN: Your first card, the Silver Dragon. This is good. You’re pure, you’re virtue, you are a worthwhile and wonderful human being, obviously, or creature of some repute.
 LAURA: That’s what everyone always tells me.
 TALIESIN: It’s true. And heading towards the Anvil.
 LAURA: What is that?
 TALIESIN: That is a destiny forged.
 ASHLEY: (deadpan) Ohh.
 TALIESIN: There is something bright and adventurous in your future.
 LAURA: Wow! You know, we did just defeat a really big snake? So maybe there’s even bigger things coming up, you know?
 TALIESIN: Can I make another roll?
 MATT: Sure.
 SAM: Ashley confirmed worst hype-man ever.
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: 19.
 MATT: Yeah, easy enough. Even with discerning eyes at the table, you are at the top of your game.
 TALIESIN: The Serpent card appears. Of course you did.
 LAURA: (gasps) Oh my gosh! Look at that! How did you even do that?
 TALIESIN: That’s all the cards. I’m simply a vessel for higher powers.
 LIAM: While everybody’s watching this shit happen, may I cast Detect Magic?
 MATT: You may. You lean back and subtly begin a brief muttering of an incantation, your fingers wash through the air, a faint silver gleam across your fingertips. Nothing magical shows up in the immediate vicinity.
 LAURA: Will you ask the cards if I’m going to find him?
 TALIESIN: If you’re going to find her?
 LAURA: Him.
 TALIESIN: Give me a little bit more. Who’s this 'him’ that you’re looking for?
 LAURA: I’m looking for my dad.
 TALIESIN: 14.
 MATT: You fumble for a second, but the card still finds its way through without issue.
 TALIESIN: Pushing through, pushing through. The Eye card pulls up. You’ve already found the clue you’re looking for. You just don’t know what it is yet.
 LAURA: Really?
 TALIESIN: Apparently. Well, it’s what the cards are saying. It’s right in front of you.
 LAURA: Wow. Does it say how long ago I found it? Because that’s–
 TALIESIN: Sadly, I don’t have that sort of specifics. That’s much more expensive.
 LAURA: That’s going to take a lot of thinking.
 TALIESIN: Well, you find us at the show, you’ll find my tent and I’d be happy to give you a more complicated reading.
 LAURA: I can’t wait! It’s going to be so much fun.
 TALIESIN: So much fun.
 MATT: Yasha, at this point, the barmaid, Adelaine, comes up and hands you the ordered ale.
 ASHLEY: Thank you, my lady.
 MATT: “On the house.”
 TALIESIN: On the house!
 ASHLEY: That’s very kind of you.
 MARISHA: Do you perform in the circus, too?
 ASHLEY: No. I do not. I just– I put it up.
 MARISHA: Oh, cool.
 TRAVIS: The tent.
 LAURA: It’s a big tent. It would take a lot of work.
 ASHLEY: I put up the stage, I move things around. I’m very strong. But I don’t do anything in the show.
 TALIESIN: Some of our acts are a little complicated, with performers who are not of the traditional variety. Can make some of the locals get a little shifty, if you know what I mean, and it’s good to have a few people around who are capable of keeping issues contained.
 MARISHA: Is that why it says 'No admittance to the elderly’? You don’t want to deal with those riley elderly. Or the ill, yeah. Why no elderly, though? Ill kind of makes sense, but elderly?
 TALIESIN: We cannot be held responsible for anything that may happen to someone who is ill or infirm. It is such an exciting, impressive show.
 ASHLEY: We’ve had people die watching it. Yeah. It’s just that exciting. Just from excitement.
 TRAVIS: Did they die in the show, or from watching it?
 ASHLEY: Yeah, just like heart attack. Just from getting so excited, I guess.
 MARISHA: We gotta get so wasted.
 LAURA: When is it? How long is it? When is it?
 MATT: It is actually the day of Grissen, and your first show is today.
 TALIESIN: First show is tonight.
 LAURA: Well, we have plans tonight!
 MARISHA: Yay!
 LAURA: Do you stinky people want to come with us?
 SAM: I– Caleb, we don’t have any plans tonight. I guess we could go along. I wouldn’t mind seeing it.
 MARISHA: It’ll be fun!
 TALIESIN: Or you could stay here and buy beer for the people who do see the shows, and you can hear all about it and pay more.
 LIAM: Yeah, we can go.
 LAURA: It’s going to be so much fun.
 SAM: Yeah, yeah, it sounds like a good night. Yeah.
 LAURA: Look at all these friends we’re making here. This is a good city.
 SAM: Yeah, it is.
 MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.
 TALIESIN: You are all the most charming people I’ve met in– yes. I finish my beer. (sighs) Well, we’d better be getting on.
 ASHLEY: Yep, nice to meet you all. You’re so, uh, wonderful.
 TALIESIN: Charm. Pure charm. See you tonight!
 MATT: And as they leave you, Yasha just downs her entire ale, slams it on the table, and they both walk out, passing a couple more flyers at off tables, and then exit out to the rest of the day’s sun beyond your sight.
 MARISHA: She was awesome.
 TRAVIS: She didn’t say much.
 MARISHA: That’s why I liked her.
 LAURA: She was really, really cool. Did you see that cool thing she had going on with her chin? That’s interesting. I wish I would have thought of something like that.
 MARISHA: Yeah, I mean, you could maybe do something like that in time. Just wait until maybe–
 LAURA: So she doesn’t know I copied. I can’t do it tonight.
 MARISHA: No, no.
 LAURA: Wow. Cool. What do you guys want to do now?
 (laughter)
 TRAVIS: Was he using magic?
 LAURA: I don’t know.
 MARISHA: Are you– you’re superstitious. Yeah?
 LAURA: No.
 MARISHA: Okay.
 LAURA: No, I’m not superstitious at all.
 MARISHA: You– sure.
 LAURA: Why?
 MARISHA: I mean, what he was working in was– he was doing a little like– he– he’s a smart guy. He’s a smart guy.
 LAURA: By the way, did you open your Christmas present from me?
 TALIESIN: No, not yet, no.
 LAURA: You should go open it! Yes! Go grab the bag!
 TALIESIN: On the break. On the break, I’ll grab it.
 SAM: Hey, Matt. Dungeon master. They’re wearing what they described. They’re not wearing any cloaks or anything right now, are they?
 MATT: Both of them have small cloaks over the shoulders, Beau has a–
 SAM: Do I recognize those cloaks?
 MATT: No, you do not.
 LAURA: What? Why would you recognize the cloaks?
 SAM: Maybe I saw something. I don’t know.
 MATT: No, you do not.
 SAM: I didn’t see them last night?
 MATT: No.
 SAM: Okay. Interesting.
 MARISHA: Mysteries.
 LIAM: Also, for the record, there was nothing magic about that. Maybe he’s good at reading people, but that was not magic.
 SAM: Caleb knows everything about magic. He’s been even teaching me some. He’s real good. You should see him–
 LIAM: Nott–
 LAURA: Caleb, are you going to go the Academy?
 LIAM: (strained laugh) That’s silly.
 SAM: He could if he wanted to. He’s really good at magic. He can make a cat appear and disappear whenever he wants.
 LAURA: Really? A cat?
 LIAM: (snaps)
 MATT: You watch as just beneath the table, this orange patchy tabby leaps up.
 MARISHA: Oh, shit! What’s his name?
 LAURA: Or her name!
 LIAM: Well, it is a he. This is my cat Frumpkin. Frumpkin, yes.
 LAURA: Aw! Can I call him Lumpy?
 LIAM: You can call him Frumpkin.
 LAURA: Look at this Lumpy! Made in England.
 (laughter)
 LIAM: That was a little show gift from Marisha, so this is Frumpkin.
 LAURA: That’s so great.
 SAM: That’s not all he can do. Caleb, tell them all the stuff you can do. It’s really impressive!
 LIAM: You know, sometimes less is more.
 LAURA: I can do things, too.
 SAM: With magic?
 LAURA: Yeah.
 SAM: Like what?
 LAURA: Like–
 SAM: Not to me, not to me!
 LAURA: Like– oh, gosh. Okay. I’m going to use Thaumaturgy and I’m going to make all the windows in the place open up really fast, like crash open.
 MATT: Okay. You watch as four of the nearby windows slam open with a sudden burst of wind, and all the various bits of torchlight that light the deeper and more shadowed corners of the room suddenly darken and flicker. The music suddenly comes to a stop. Everyone holds their position and glances over at the table where you’re all sitting.
 TRAVIS: Jester, don’t you remember us talking about keeping a low profile?
 LAURA: You’re right. I’m sorry. I use Thaumaturgy and I close all the windows.
 (laughter)
 MATT: They all slam shut a second time. The light flickers and then brightens back to its normal place.
 LAURA: Ta-da!
 MARISHA: Yeah! Yeah!
 LAURA: Come see me tonight at the carnival! I’m really good!
 MATT: One really crotchety-looking guy in his early 50s with a super underbite, probably missing most of his teeth, just goes–
 (laughter)
 LIAM: I telepathically tell Frumpkin to jump up and sit in the lap of the woman in the monk’s robes who just made a big scene and hopefully keep her occupied with being cute.
 MATT: Okay. As soon as you sit down, Frumpkin leaps into your lap and starts purring and rubbing up against your hand.
 MARISHA: Hey, buddy. Look at this kitty! I think he likes me.
 LIAM: Sure, right now he likes you.
 MARISHA: Is this a real cat? Or is this a fake cat?
 LIAM: What do you mean, a fake cat?
 MARISHA: Like a magic cat.
 LIAM: He’s both a real cat and a magic cat.
 MARISHA: Is he an illusion cat?
 LIAM: Do you feel him?
 TRAVIS: Could you put him over there?
 MARISHA: Are you allergic to Frumpkins? Oh no!
 LAURA: But he’s a magic cat. How can you be allergic to magic cats?
 TRAVIS: I’m pretty sure he’s a real fucking cat.
 MARISHA: He’s one of those hypoallergenic magic cats.
 LIAM: I don’t know what the Fifth Edition rules are–
 LAURA: –for cat dander?
 MATT: As far as you know right now? Yeah, he’s having an actual allergic attack. A minor one.
 MARISHA: I walk away a little bit from Fjord.
 LIAM: Shit.
 (laughter)
 SAM: Well, you’re both magic-users, then. And so is the larger fellow?
 TRAVIS: Well, I mean, a little.
 LAURA: Yeah, I mean, he’s learning. He’s getting really good at it.
 TRAVIS: Trying to learn more.
 LAURA: Yeah, you should have seen him. He disguised himself the other day, and it was like,
 (clicks tongue).
 TRAVIS: Thanks, Jester. She’s better at it than I am. We’re trying to make our way up to the Academy to get a little bit more learning done.
 LAURA: Well, he’s going to learn. I’m not going to go to the Academy.
 MARISHA: Man, this Academy place keeps getting brought up.
 TRAVIS: Well yeah, it’s the place to be.
 MARISHA: Okay.
 SAM: I’m sorry, what Academy are we talking about?
 TRAVIS: Solstryce Academy. You know.
 MATT: Soltryce.
 LAURA: Yeah, that one.
 SAM: The Soul Train Academy.
 LIAM: It’s a very fancy place.
 TRAVIS: You know it.
 LIAM: I have heard of it.
 TRAVIS: And you have arcane talents as well.
 LIAM: Yeah.
 LAURA: How long have you had yours?
 LIAM: That’s a tricky question. I studied when I was younger, and then I gave it up for a while. I picked it up again recently. It’s all book-learned.
 LAURA: Wow, that’s cool.
 MARISHA: This was a good way to go for your first.
 LAURA: A frickin’ cat!
 MARISHA: This is kind of therapeutic. Making me feel better, just about life in general.
 TRAVIS: (sneezes)
 MARISHA: All right.
 SAM: He reads lots of books, Caleb does. He’s very smart. In fact, should we go looking for more right now?
 LIAM: Maybe in a little while.
 LAURA: Can I see one of your books?
 LIAM: Well– and I pull apart the lapels of my coat. I have books in what modern-day people like to think of as holster-straps, but there’s a book hanging here.
 SAM: I think ancient people would call it a holster as well.
 LIAM: Bap-bap-bap. The books are right here. I have these, but these are heirlooms, family heirlooms, so I don’t share those, but– no, I like to read. That’s all. And I’m a bit of a self-starter, so I have to find– I mean, good luck at the Academy. That’s rough, I hear.
 TRAVIS: Do you know anything about it? We’re just going up. Beginner’s luck.
 LAURA: We know it’s rich people that go there. We have to find a way to get you in.
 LIAM: All I know is how hard it is to get into.
 SAM: You don’t have a lot of money, then?
 LAURA: Well.
 TRAVIS: No.
 LAURA: We had more.
 MARISHA: But then we lost it, but then we got it back.
 TRAVIS: Somebody has a gambling problem.
 SAM: Oh. Which one?
 LAURA: What’s the name of it again?
 MATT: It is the Crick-Queen’s Call.
 LAURA: Have you played it?
 SAM: No, I haven’t.
 LAURA: I’ll teach you someday. It’s so much fun.
 SAM: It’s a game?
 LAURA: Yes.
 SAM: Cards? All right. I might like to know that.
 LAURA: I mean, I can teach you, if you want.
 SAM: Yes, I would like to know that.
 LAURA: Okay, I’ll deal!
 SAM: Oh, right now?
 LAURA: Yes, sure, this will be fun.
 SAM: Is this okay?
 LIAM: Listen, I would not be sitting here if it were not for you. Do whatever you like.
 LAURA: Okay. You draw three cards. Well, I give you three cards. So you use 3d6.
 SAM: 3d6.
 LAURA: Yeah.
 SAM: Got one. I’m not you. I have one of each dice.
 (laughter)
 LAURA: Okay. So hide your roll from me, because we can’t know. So first you have to ante up. How much coin do you want to put in?
 SAM: I’m out.
 (laughter)
 LIAM: It’s all right. I will front some coin for you to play this game.
 LAURA: Oh, great! How much do you want to front him?
 LIAM: I will give you a silver piece.
 LAURA: A silver. Okay, this is great.
 SAM: Thank you, Caleb. Thank you.
 LIAM: Wish I had more.
 LAURA: Okay. Am I doing this right?
 MATT: So far.
 LAURA: Now I’m going to give us three cards, so we both roll, but we can’t see. That’s good. Okay.
 MARISHA: Don’t say 'that’s good’.
 LAURA: Bluffing. How do you know I wasn’t?
 SAM: I’m going to try to change one of my cards.
 LAURA: No, wait, there’s rules!
 SAM: Without you seeing.
 MATT: Make a sleight-of-hand check.
 SAM: 12 plus eight, so that’s 20.
 MATT: Make a perception check.
 LAURA: No, he totally did it. She totally did it. This is really hard, Sam.
 LIAM: You’re only an hour and a half in.
 SAM: This is my only skill, guys.
 LAURA: But, you know, that’s my skill, too.
 SAM: Oh, shit.
 LAURA: So I’m going to try to do it as well, 'cause that’s my skill as well.
 MATT: Well, first, what’d you roll for–
 LAURA: I did not notice him doing it.
 MATT: Okay, yeah, so you only get to reroll one of the dice.
 LAURA: Okay, so I’m going to try to reroll one of my three, too.
 MATT: Go ahead. So make a sleight-of-hand check.
 LAURA: Oh, right. Oh, shit.
 SAM: Do I notice her?
 MATT: Well, roll a perception check.
 SAM: Nope.
 LAURA: 13?
 SAM: No, I rolled three.
 LAURA: Okay. So the best hand you can get is three of a kind. Then, after that, it’s a straight. A high straight. Then a low straight. Then it’s if you get all evens, or if you get all odds, then it’s two of a kind, then it’s nothing, it’s just high card. Okay, but now we put in a second amount, because you can up the ante, and you get one more card.
 SAM: I’m out.
 LAURA: No, but wait, wait, wait. You can put in more money, and then I deal you a different card. You get to give a card back, and then I deal you another card.
 SAM: Should I? Caleb, do you have any more?
 LIAM: Because you saved my life yesterday, you may have one more silver piece.
 LAURA: One more silver. Okay, I’ll keep it low, too, because you’re only doing the one. So I only put in one silver, too.
 MATT: That’s a four-silver pot.
 LAURA: Yes. And now give one of your dice back, whichever one you don’t want, and roll it again.
 MATT: So you get to reroll.
 SAM: Okay, got it.
 MATT: And you get to reroll one as well.
 LAURA: I don’t want to reroll any. Okay. Now you show what you got and we’ll see who wins.
 SAM: I got a pair of fours.
 LAURA: I got three fives.
 SAM: I draw my shortsword.
 (laughter)
 MARISHA: I immediately grapple him.
 MATT: Make an athletics check. You make an acrobatics check.
 SAM: Acrobatics? 24.
 MARISHA: 14.
 MATT: So the female goblin draws a shortsword. You reach out to grab, and she slips out of your grasp and is now holding the blade at the edge of the table.
 SAM: You’re cheating. Somehow you’re cheating.
 LIAM: Nott, Nott, that’s fine. That’s fine. She won my two silver pieces. We’ll just leave it at that.
 SAM: I’m sorry.
 LIAM: That’s okay. She’s very jumpy sometimes. You can understand; we’ve been living in the woods for a long time. Every time we come near any place like this, we’re attacked, jumped, followed. So I apologize on behalf of–
 SAM: That was stupid. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have done that. I’m sorry.
 LAURA: No, it’s okay. Just don’t do it again. But I’m sorry I took all this money from your friend.
 LIAM: That’s making it worse.
 TRAVIS: Maybe you could give some of it back.
 LAURA: Why, though? But I won it.
 SAM: Your Laura is showing.
 (laughter)
 LAURA: Tell you what. I’ll give you– none of it back, I can’t! Okay, here’s one silver back–
 LIAM: No, I insist.
 LAURA: Okay, but I insist, all the money back. All right, fine, it’s mine, thank you. Yay.
 SAM: I need another drink.
 LIAM: A round of Trosts for both our tables, please.
 LAURA: See? Isn’t that the most fun?
 SAM: It’s fun.
 MATT: Yorda looks over and goes, “Any preference of family?”
 LIAM: Not Baumbauch.
 MATT: “Von Brandt it is.”
 MARISHA: I’m impressed that you stuck to taking a guy’s money in a training game.
 LAURA: Right? Oh, wait, is that bad?
 MARISHA: Meh.
 LAURA: Well, I only learned last night, you guys.
 LIAM: What is a training game?
 MARISHA: Just meaning when she was teaching.
 LAURA: People took my money when I was learning.
 LIAM: It’s fine. It’s water under the bridge. It’s fine. It’s all right.
 MATT: Another round is brought to your table. You guys can share a solemn post-game drink amongst yourselves.
 LIAM: If you feel slightly worse, there’s a drink on me.
 LAURA: Oh jeez, now I’m definitely giving you your two silver back. Don’t worry about it, man.
 (laughter)
 SAM: She’s just a couple of wild and crazy guys over here.
 (laughter)
 LAURA: Have my baked goods come out yet?
 MATT: They have. Your meal’s been presented for a while now. You’ve had the opportunity to eat most of your meal.
 SAM: That’s real.
 MATT: That is actually real. That’s the power of imagination, Sam. That wasn’t there a second ago.
 TALIESIN: Bangarang!
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: Right there for you.
 MATT: So you all finish your independent meals and decide to continue your conversations or go about your business for the day.
 LAURA: I just want to go to the carnival.
 LIAM: That’s later tonight, though, isn’t it?
 MATT: If you have no other business, we can wait until dusk.
 SAM: Well, there’s that board on the wall. Has anything new been posted on the board?
 MATT: You go ahead and take a look at it. There is one sheet that pertains to somebody in the Hills Ward looking for folks to go ahead and do an extermination run near the southern portion of the Ustaloch. It looks like there’s what looks to be a vole infestation.
 TRAVIS: What the fuck is a vole?
 MATT: It’s a small rat.
 LAURA: Should we do it?
 MARISHA: I mean, we have to kill Rodents of Unusual Size.
 SAM: That doesn’t sound interesting to me at all.
 TRAVIS: What else is there?
 MATT: Currently, it looks like there was another sheet that looks like most has been torn off. The rest of the board is pretty empty at the moment.
 LIAM: DM, did I tear that? I can’t remember.
 MATT: You did, yes.
 SAM: Wasn’t it a delivery thing?
 LIAM: That was what it was, yeah.
 MATT: It was to help move and load crates at one of the local breweries.
 SAM: Fuck that.
 LAURA: We’ve done that. It sucked so much.
 SAM: You did that?
 LAURA: Well, by mistake.
 MARISHA: We played DandD and we moved crates for eight hours.
 (laughter)
 TRAVIS: We did, yeah.
 MATT: Welcome to level two.
 SAM: We said no to that job, thank you.
 TRAVIS: We get bored pretty easily.
 MARISHA: We did, however, then gamble with the other workers and then Jester– yeah. Jester–
 LAURA: Well, I lost it, but he made so much.
 TRAVIS: Maybe not out loud say that. Just a thought.
 MARISHA: Oh, that’s right. We probably shouldn’t. We didn’t make any money.
 LAURA: Do you guys want company? Do you want us to come and hang out with you today?
 SAM: I don’t know about that. That sounds risky, I don’t know.
 LIAM: Do you know something? I, shockingly, think that’s not a bad idea.
 SAM: To have these weirdos with us?
 LAURA: I can hear you.
 LIAM: Yesterday was a very bad day.
 SAM: Yes. Well, I suppose if we surrounded ourselves with weirdos, then maybe it would take some of heat off of me.
 LIAM: Well, yes. Bottom line: can you hang with the goblin?
 LAURA: Bottom line– and I touch Nott’s shoulder, and I cast Blessing of the Trickster.
 SAM: Oh, Jesus, she’s going to kill me right now.
 (laughter)
 SAM: Any magic kills a goblin instantly. Yeah, instantly.
 (laughter)
 LAURA: That would be the worst character choice ever.
 (laughter)
 LIAM: We will mourn her. Tschuss.
 MATT: Okay, so there’s a slight sense of warmth that emanates from under her hand, and for a moment, you look over and glance instinctively, ready to almost draw your sword again. But it seems to quicken your reflexes. You have this surge of adrenaline that doesn’t quite fade.
 LAURA: You have advantage on all your stealth checks.
 MATT: For the next hour.
 SAM: Thank you. That’s very nice.
 TRAVIS: I don’t have a problem with goblins, but you guys aren’t in any trouble, are you? No one’s after you?
 LAURA: Because she is all kinds of trouble.
 SAM: No one is after me!
 TRAVIS: Can I make an insight check?
 MATT: You may.
 (laughter)
 TRAVIS: 13.
 MATT: 13. If you want to go ahead and try and lie.
 SAM: That’s a 14, except negative three to performance.
 TALIESIN: I’ve been waiting for this for so long.
 SAM: So 11.
 MATT: So, are you lying?
 SAM: I am lying. I am definitely on the run from someone.
 TRAVIS: Good to know.
 MARISHA: So. Mask. I’m just fascinated by the mask. Looks well-made. Did you make it?
 SAM: That’s a good fucking question. Did I make it?
 (laughter)
 SAM: I don’t make things.
 MATT: No, I presume– and we discussed this a little bit– we presume it may have been scavenged from a porcelain doll.
 SAM: Oh, that’s cool. Cool and gross, cool and gross.
 LAURA: What’s her name? The creepy doll?
 TRAVIS: Annabelle.
 (laughter)
 LAURA: No, don’t say that. I don’t want to see art with you with Annabelle’s face.
 SAM: Too late.
 MATT: The internet’s running with that now.
 SAM: Check your Twitter.
 TRAVIS: It seems we have all day. What were your plans?
 LIAM: Not much. We were going to sample the different Trosts, and I wanted to maybe do some book browsing. Nothing major.
 LAURA: What’s a Trost?
 MARISHA: Brewery tour!
 SAM: It’s ale.
 LAURA: We just can’t go by the Baumbauch ale.
 SAM: What happened with the Baumbauchs?
 LIAM: There are two others to choose from, here.
 MARISHA: They’re who we loaded crates for, and then we kind of swindled their employee.
 TRAVIS: Didn’t leave on the best of terms.
 LIAM: DM, which one is the one that everybody knows has got the blessing of Fryda Langer?
 MATT: No, that is actually the Baumbauch.
 LIAM: Shit.
 MATT: Yeah, the Starosta is kind of tied with the Baumbauch family.
 TALIESIN: We’re imaginary beer snobs now.
 LAURA: Is that the one you need?
 LIAM: No, I’m just saying the one that you swindled, it’s got the blessing of the big cheese here.
 LAURA: Oh. Well. Why do you need it?
 LIAM: We don’t need it. It’s just pleasurable to have a Trost, is what they say. She kind of needs it.
 SAM: I need it a little bit.
 LAURA: You need a beer?
 SAM: Well, I prefer the harder stuff, but I’ll take what I can get at this point. Yeah, I’m sticking with this fucking accent for the next two years.
 (laughter)
 TRAVIS: Laryngitis every Friday.
 (laughter)
 MARISHA: So beer tour, then circus?
 LAURA: I’ve got to say, I miss those two people we ran into at the carnival.
 TRAVIS: I might just wait for the carnival, actually.
 MARISHA: Well, if we just montage through a beer tour, we’ll quickly get to the circus. To the carnival!
 MATT: You can totally do that.
 LIAM: Can we just bring my book-browsing down to a single roll to see if anything of use–
 MATT: Yeah, we can do that. We’ll say, if you guys decide to go ahead and travel, the five of you, you make your way through the town for the day, you coast around the Husseldorf family brewery, you meet Voss and June, who are the two very nice ladies who run the facility. The Husseldorf family. You avoid the Baumbauch, but can acquire Baumbauch ale from other taverns in the town, of course. And the von Brandt family brewery. All of them, as soon as you say 'Trost’, they correct you and say the family name. They’re very intent on getting rid of the name 'Trost’ as an overall, discussion of Trost-brand brews, and trying to make it their family name. There’s an offense, to the point where you’re like, “Oh, Jesus. I didn’t realize.”
 TALIESIN: Like Kleenex and tissue paper? All right.
 MATT: But you manage to get nice and sauced throughout the day.
 LIAM: I take it easy. I have one more in the first half of the day, and one in the second half.
 MATT: Okay.
 LAURA: I don’t have very much either.
 MATT: Okay.
 SAM: I’m going to have tons.
 MARISHA: I get sauced.
 MATT: All right, well, that being the case–
 LIAM: –you are poisoned.
 MATT: No, make a constitution saving throw.
 SAM: Well, that was crazy. 12.
 MATT: 12, okay. You get a little woozy for a while, and as the sun begins to crawl towards the distant horizon, you do not manage to allow your meal to usurp your control.
 LAURA: Aw, it’s like Ren Faire.
 MATT: Yeah. Don’t remind me.
 MARISHA: Good times, good times.
 MATT: So as the day comes to a close, you’re fairly tipsy, you’re not fully intoxicated. For your trip, you wanted to head to the Hillsbrook Parchment and Binding.
 LIAM: Is that where I went the last time? Except not as myself. So I’ll go as myself.
 MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an investigation check.
 LIAM: All right. Don’t fuck me, Vax. That is–
 LAURA: That’s Vax. That’s Vax’s dice.
 LIAM: Yeah, the thing about even a light German accent is that when you say “Vex” and “Vax”, it’s the same shit.
 (laughter)
 LIAM: That is a 12.
 MATT: 12. You take the better part of 30 minutes or so, and you find there’s a lot of books on farming techniques. There’s a lot of books about how to grow, care for different types of vegetation, plants, various beasts of burden. You find books on the different seasons and what’s best for different types of grain and wheats. You manage to pull through and find a couple of books that deal with discussion of the Menagerie Coast that talk about what’s called the Clovis Concord. It’s more of a discussion of the political structure that maintains all the city-states there.
 LIAM: And the person who ran this place was an older man, right? Just sipping tea.
 MATT: Yeah, Sheenah, yeah.
 LIAM: I’m sorry. You have a nice selection here. Do you mind if I ask– I haven’t seen any other booksellers of any kind in town. I’m not really looking for anything on farming, so much. Is there anywhere else I could look into?
 MATT: “If you’re looking for some sort of a library, your best bet is to go to Zadash up north.”
 LIAM: Zadash.
 MATT: “That’s where the Library of the Cobalt Soul resides. They have all the information you could hope for. A bit pricey to peruse their interior, unless you have proper coverage, but unfortunately if what we have isn’t what you’re looking for, I can’t help you.”
 LIAM: No, it’s a fine selection. Sorry. How much for this book on hoe technique?
 MATT: “Oh! Jamieson’s Hoedown, yes, quite. That will be two silver pieces.”
 LIAM: Oh. I’m very embarrassed, I’m sorry, I gave away my last two silver pieces.
 LAURA: No, I gave it back to you, remember?
 LIAM: I gave away my last two silver pieces, so. Maybe I can earn it back and come back later this week.
 MATT: “Please do. Do you want me to hold it for you?”
 LIAM: Yes.
 MATT: “What’s your name?”
 LIAM: My name is Caleb Widogast.
 MATT: “All right. I will keep it here under the shelf. Thank you so much.”
 LIAM: Okay, good day, thank you.
 LAURA: Is this a big shop?
 MATT: It’s a boutique. It’s designed almost like a cross. There’s two cross-sections of hallways that have books across the walls, and there’s a window at the end of each and then a door at the far back.
 LAURA: While he was talking to the shopkeeper, I’m going to take out as many books as I can and move them around on the shelves, and then take some of them and turn them around to where their binding is facing the inside.
 MATT: Go ahead and make a sleight-of-hand check.
 LAURA: Natural 20!
 MATT: Over the period of him searching and distracting this man, you have completely rearranged the interior of this bookstore, to the point where even in the far corner, you Ghostbusters stack them in the center of the room, floor-to-ceiling, with him not even noticing it.
 LIAM: You little fucking poltergeist.
 MATT: You feel confident and happy and a sensation of approval washes over you. All right, so.
 LAURA: I skip out the door.
 MATT: Okay. You turn around from having this conversation and notice the interior is not as you last saw it, and a bit of nerves begin to brew up under you.
 LIAM: Frumpkin, come on.
 MATT: (meows) Frumpkin follows behind.
 LIAM: Oh yes! Matt’s got to make cat sounds now!
 MATT: I didn’t even think about that until now. God damn it. All right, so as you guys have gathered at this point, the oranges and the pinks of dusk begin to peek through the quite-cloudy sky, the chilled air of the coming night sky signalling the Crown’s Guard to begin lighting the hanging lanterns that line the streets of Trostenwald. A renewed energy takes the streets as the sound of a fiddle seems to creep through the night air.
 SAM: My god, Ashley’s a master fiddler, isn’t she?
 ASHLEY: Beedle-deedle.
 (laughter)
 TRAVIS: I love how your fiddle noises were “beedle-deedle”.
 ASHLEY: That’s the sound for all instruments, right?
 SAM: Drums.
 LIAM: By the way, DM, can I ask– sometime in the entire day, when Nott was getting wasted, could I have spent an hour using Arcane Recovery to gain back that one spell slot I used this morning?
 MATT: Sure, yeah. I’ll allow that. All right. Folks begin to prod their heads out into the open air, curious about the source of this unusual din, and you find your vision capturing a small procession of flamboyantly dressed people parading through the central road. A lanky man of some obvious elven descent leads the pack, his long, ashy-brown hair curling ever-so-slightly past his mid-back, his long coat and tails knocking around by his skipping step. Two halfling women in purple and green bodysuits dance from side to side, handing flowers to children and flyers to adults, as a bald man in a neck-frilled frock coat of bright red, his face adorned in vibrant orange makeup to look like the setting sun behind him, plays the violin that you heard earlier in an upbeat, jovial manner. A tall half-orc masculine man with a well-groomed handlebar mustache that curves out to the side, billowing white silk shirt and black trousers, follows behind with a big drum slung over his shoulder, going (drumming) along with the fiddle. The tiefling man of lavender skin that you saw earlier walks along with a grin, juggling two curved scimitars as he walks in place, almost loses one and catches it, continues to go. Families are beginning to gather out to see this display. The two dancers part, and then a woman of short, fiery red hair and dark skin walking between them, lifting a small candle before– fwoosh! A giant burst, a gout of flame emerges from the front of her mouth, brightens the vicinity, and everyone collectively gasps and begins cheering and clapping as they continue the walk. There, to the back of it, you see the rather burly-looking pale woman, arms crossed, just following behind and keeping an eye like a security guard to ensure that no business gets out of hand. The gasps and the cheers begin to follow, and as the procession continues down its way, the families and civilians begin to gather and follow behind. As the last bit of the sun sets behind the mountain range, the torches glowing, the procession curves through the center of the Loch Ward to the edge of the Ustaloch itself. Through the fishing village, more folks begin to gather. Do you all follow?
 ALL: Yeah.
 LAURA: And I cast Blessing of the Trickster on you again, just in case.
 SAM: Thank you.
 MATT: People following the parade, you see faces, eager for this fresh form of entertainment. Children laugh and chatter excitedly, while the Crown’s Guard in their familiar bronze and vermilion uniform try to maintain order between themselves being quite curious or visibly mistrusting of these hooligans that suddenly have usurped the evening air. The procession continues towards the eastern side, out along the southern edge of this Loch Ward, to the Ustaloch’s southern place, towards the new, completely constructed, large, dark blue tent. Lengthy streamers of white and silver flap with the cold winds from the top of the structure. As you guys walk, you watch as the horned tiefling you had approached earlier slowly saunters up to your side, you recognizing these individuals you had spoken with earlier.
 MARISHA: I go, Molly! Molly, hey!
 TALIESIN: Oh, it’s my favorites. Hello.
 LAURA: We came!
 TALIESIN: I’m so glad you all came to see the show. It’s going to be great tonight.
 ASHLEY: (deadpan) It’s going to blow you away.
 (laughter)
 SAM: The hype continues.
 ASHLEY: You’re going to love it.
 TALIESIN: First show of a round’s always the best. Without fail.
 MARISHA: Where are the best seats?
 TALIESIN: Well, I’m always partial to the front. Then you’re right in it, if something goes wrong, it’s nothing between you and whatever terrible, bloody mess is going to happen. It’s just the best.
 MARISHA: What?
 TALIESIN: Nothing, nothing, you’re fine.
 ASHLEY: It’s going to be great, but before you go in, I do have to give you guys a pat-down, 'cause you can’t go in with any weapons.
 MATT: At this point, a voice rings out behind you, you see as the carnival master Gustav glances over your shoulder and goes, “You two, skip ahead, quick. We need to go ahead and set up. Looks like we’re already having quite a few people excited to come here, so at the door, interior to set up. Meet us at the front. Actually, you know what? You’ll be on card duty. We need a little extra change on the side.”
 TALIESIN: Card duty it is.
 MATT: “All right. Folks, excited for your patronage.” As he spins around and addresses the whole crowd now and says, “Enjoy the night air. Walk slowly. We need just a moment to set up.” And the half-elf man bows and tips his large– it looks almost like a top hat that gets floppy towards the top and flops forward, and he puts it back on top and begins sauntering, continuing the music, but picking up their pace to get ahead of the crowd as they draw you all slowly towards the exterior tent. And that’s where we’re going to go ahead and take our break.
 (yelling)
 TRAVIS: Face is on fire.
 LAURA: Am I the only one going, do we really have to give up our weapons? I don’t feel okay with this.
 SAM: Ashley, I’ll do whatever you want, but if you take my weapons I might kill you.
 ASHLEY: I’d like to see you try.
 (yelling)
 MATT: All right, so. We’ll be back here in a few minutes. We’re going to take a quick break. We have our weekly giveaway from our friends at Wyrmwood. We have a white oak complete dice tower system that’s a three-piece set. That’s going to be given away to one of you there in the chat. The password, if I recall, is 'beginnings’. Yeah. This one. If you’re in the Twitch chat, if you want to be part of this, when you’re prompted there, go ahead and enter the word 'beginnings’ once. If you enter it more than once, you’ll get disqualified, so be careful with that. Otherwise, it gets this spamming spree of chaos. So the word is 'beginnings’. When prompted, go ahead and enter that, and we’ll come back from the break with the winner of that. Regardless, guys, welcome to the beginning of the new campaign.
 (yelling)
 MATT: We’ll see you here in a few minutes.
 LIAM: Magic!
 LAURA: Magic!
 
 Part II Edit 
 MATT: Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Guys! Wow!
 LIAM: Grenade lobbed in by Foster at the last second.
 MATT: I know. Welcome back. So, first and foremost, we have our winner of the white oak complete dice tower from our friends at Wyrmwood. The winner is GTDevoto. Congratulations. Denova will reach out to you and get your contact information. Everyone else, thank you for entering. We’ll have more with each future episode of Critical Role, thanks to our friends at Wyrmwood Gaming. Also, as a heads-up for those who aren’t familiar and for those who may be, we have a Tuesday aftershow of this called Talks Machina where our friend W. Brian Foster Esq., just mixing up all of his names– you guys know him, Brian W. Foster, friend of the show, is the host of the show, and he’ll be there Tuesday talking about this episode tonight with some of the cast. 7PM Pacific time on Tuesday. So. Anyway.
 (laughter)
 MATT: Bringing us back.
 TRAVIS: Bring that ass back.
 SAM: Five dragons swoop down.
 (laughter)
 MATT: It’s so hackneyed. As you guys begin to approach the outside of this large, dark navy tent, people are being inspected and ushered through by the well-groomed half-orc on one side, and the pale woman, Yasha, you met for a second time approaching the outskirts of this carnival, with entry fees being collected by both as people begin to pass into this large structure. A few feet off to the side, you see a small crowd gathered around Mollymauk, who is sitting atop a small blanket and has cards splayed before him, a similar set that you saw Jester toying with earlier, and a farmer sits across from him, listening intently. “All right, so what can you tell me about this here cough?”
 TALIESIN: How long have you had it?
 MATT: “Oh, going on like three, four months.” (coughs)
 TALIESIN: It looks like it’s getting better. Oh yes. Does it feel like it’s getting better?
 MATT: “Oh, right now? Yeah.”
 TALIESIN: Yeah, look at that. I would maybe breathe a tincture or something. Let’s– yeah, maybe you should get that looked at.
 MATT: “From who? What do the cards tell me?”
 TALIESIN: Some sort of physician, perhaps.
 MATT: “Right! Of course! Oh, thank you so much.” And he places a–
 TALIESIN: Platinum Dragon be with you. Thank you.
 MATT: Stands up. “Dear, a physician!” And he walks off.
 (laughter)
 MARISHA: What happened to 'no sick people’?
 TALIESIN: This is outside the tent.
 MATT: Yeah, he doesn’t enter the tent. He goes off to the side.
 MARISHA: Fair.
 TALIESIN: It’s good to see you all here, though.
 LAURA: Here’s the thing. Some of us have weapons that we don’t want to pass away to other people, so how much of a chance is it that we could get through without having to do that, you know?
 ASHLEY: Well, you can’t see the show if you have a weapon on you.
 LAURA: Right. And we really want to see the show. But, you know, we are really good at security, like all of us are really strong, and we could fight things that came up, too, so maybe it would be best if you don’t take our weapons, and then we could help.
 MARISHA: Actually, here’s a deal. We’ll make you a good deal. You waive our entry fee and if anyone needs to be kicked out, or any security needs to happen, we’ll help you out.
 SAM: Like deputy bouncers?
 MARISHA: Like deputy bouncers.
 ASHLEY: Well, see, funny thing about that, though, is that’s my job. So.
 LAURA: So do you want to hire us?
 ASHLEY: No.
 MARISHA: You would be like our boss. Have you ever wanted to be a boss? Like, in charge?
 ASHLEY: Well, I am.
 LAURA: We could ask you for days off sometimes.
 MATT: A heavy greenish-grey-skinned mitt slaps onto Beau’s shoulder, as you glance over to see the large, well-groomed half-orc man standing there. “I’m terribly sorry, but we’ve got it taken care of. If you wish to pay entry, you can, but the rules are the rules. So sorry.”
 LIAM: Do they get stored in some sort of locker or something?
 ASHLEY: I hold them. And if you want, I can stand right next to you guys. You can keep your eye on me the whole time.
 TALIESIN: She’s very trustworthy.
 LIAM: That seems fair-ish to me.
 MATT: “Yasha, does that seem– all right.”
 MARISHA: I look at him as I take his hand off. What’s your name, by the by?
 MATT: “Bo.”
 MARISHA: Good name.
 MATT: “Thank you.”
 LIAM: Well, that’s funny, because your name is also Beau.
 MATT: “Really?”
 MARISHA: You didn’t have to– maybe let me choose when to tell people–
 MATT: “No, no, I’m curious about this. How do you spell your name?”
 MARISHA: Well, it’s short for Beauregard.
 MATT: “Oh, mine’s just B-O.”
 MARISHA: That’s unfortunate. I mean, it’s great. Did kids make fun– never mind.
 MATT: “It’s not inaccurate.” And he flicks the side of his mustache.
 (laughter)
 LAURA: Like, is his mustache especially B.O.-y? Like, what? That’s really gross.
 MATT: Make a perception check.
 LAURA: Ew. I don’t want to perceive this. I’m glad I didn’t roll very well.
 MARISHA: Can I make an insight check? Is he a creep or is he just–
 MATT: Make an insight check. Eight? Thankfully, you’re not in proximity enough to catch a whiff of his mustache.
 MARISHA: Natural 20.
 MATT: Okay. Interestingly enough, he seems very well put-together. And he seems like he’s just fucking with you. He’s having fun, and he’s messing with you, and he’s just casual and competent and actually pretty well-groomed. He doesn’t smell. And he seems more just enjoying the discourse.
 MARISHA: It’s funny, see, my name’s Beau because my parents wanted a son.
 MATT: “Well. If it helps with any other confusion, call me the Breaker. Well, if you see the rest of the show, perhaps you’ll see why I got my name.”
 LAURA: Are you in the show, too?
 MATT: And he cracks his arms. “I am. Towards the end.”
 TRAVIS: Now I want to see the show.
 MATT: “Well then. May I?” You can see now the crowd’s starting to queue up behind you pretty heavily. “Besides, if you’re going to enter, we’ve got to get through the rest of this riff-raff. Do you wish to join in?”
 LIAM: I pull– all I have is a dagger, but I just hand it to Yasha.
 LAURA: Just one dagger?
 ASHLEY: I promise you I will give it back.
 LIAM: Yes, here you go.
 ASHLEY: I promise you I will give you all of your weapons back.
 LAURA: Pinky-swear me, Yasha.
 ASHLEY: Ugh. I don’t like–
 LAURA: Yeah! Now we’re best friends. Here’s my sickle.
 MARISHA: I have a staff, but I also use it as a walking stick, so I like to keep it on me.
 TALIESIN: Can you not walk around without it or something?
 LAURA: She has a really bad limp.
 MARISHA: Sometimes I get a little twinge, a little disc issue.
 TALIESIN: Can you hand me your staff so I can watch this? I want to see this limp of yours. Purely for my own entertainment.
 MARISHA: Are you patronizing me, Mollymauk?
 TALIESIN: No, I’m hoping that you’re going to patronize us.
 (laughter)
 MARISHA: Can I keep my stick?
 (laughter)
 ASHLEY: How about this? I’ll take it, and I can just carry you to your seat.
 MARISHA: Deal.
 LAURA: How are you carrying all of these weapons?
 ASHLEY: Because I’m really fucking strong.
 (laughter)
 ASHLEY: You. Can I give him a pat-down, because you’re–
 MATT: Sure, roll an investigation check. I’ll give you advantage because you’re really good at this.
 LIAM: I open up the coat just so she can see the books.
 ASHLEY: I don’t think I find anything. 12.
 MATT: You find two books and a modicum of change and nothing else on him. He’s actually pretty sparse as far as collectibles and keepsakes.
 ASHLEY: I just thought your chest looked rather square, so I wanted to see what was happening.
 LIAM: I’m practically concave. Is it concave or convex, I forget?
 ALL: Concave.
 MARISHA: Convex would be funny.
 (laughter)
 SAM: I’ll hand her my shortsword, but not my little crossbow.
 MATT: Okay, make a sleight-of-hand check to try and hide that.
 SAM: Four. Oh, wait. 12.
 MATT: You have advantage on that, technically, right? Dexterity checks?
 SAM: Well, did you give me dexterity or just stealth? How does that work?
 LAURA: I think it’s just stealth checks with the blessing.
 MATT: Let me double-check that real fast.
 ALL: Going to the book.
 MATT: What the heck!
 SAM: We’re playing First Edition, right?
 MATT: No, it is stealth. You’re correct. Yeah.
 LAURA: Sorry, I wish I wouldn’t have said it and then you could have had advantage just then, but I’m not a cheater.
 SAM: No, you’re not.
 LIAM: Out of game.
 MATT: You see him slowly pocketing this crossbow.
 ASHLEY: No, no, no. Little girl.
 SAM: I’m just a little girl.
 ASHLEY: Give me your other weapon.
 SAM: This is a toy for little children. All right, here. I’m sorry.
 LAURA: Are you keeping track of what goes with what person? Because it’s a lot.
 TALIESIN: She’s very good at this.
 ASHLEY: I’m very good.
 LIAM: I just drag Nott five feet over. That is two strikes against you. I think we should really just sort of enjoy the show tonight.
 SAM: All right. But what if someone attacks us?
 LIAM: Well, I’ll handle that for you, okay?
 SAM: All right.
 MARISHA: Also, little girls don’t tend to tell people they’re little girls.
 SAM: This is my first time.
 (laughter)
 LIAM: When someone is a goblin in the middle of a town where people hate goblins–
 LAURA: Stop saying the word 'goblin’. People are going to hear you.
 SAM: I mean, she’s kind of right.
 (laughter)
 LIAM: Technically, I dragged her away, but you know, DandD is funny with what is known and not.
 TALIESIN: I heard you over the earring.
 ALL: Aww.
 LIAM: RIP.
 ASHLEY: Wait, I didn’t get your weapon.
 TRAVIS: Hah.
 ASHLEY: Do you want to stare at me all day, or do you want to give me the weapon so you can go watch the show?
 TRAVIS: That’s an interesting choice.
 ASHLEY: It’s not really a choice.
 TRAVIS: Sure.
 MATT: What do you pull out?
 TRAVIS: My falchion.
 SAM: Your what?
 MATT: A falchion, a large, curved sword, emerges from a sheath on his back.
 SAM: What is that?
 ALL: It’s a large, curved sword.
 (laughter)
 ASHLEY: I twist it around a little. Play with it. This is nice.
 TALIESIN: Very nice.
 ASHLEY: I like it.
 SAM: It’s a falchion!
 LAURA: You’re going to hang out with us the whole night?
 ASHLEY: I’ll hang out beside you so you can watch.
 MATT: Make a perception check.
 TRAVIS: 11.
 MATT: 11, that’s enough. As she spins the falchion around, you notice that, affixed to her back, in uncharacteristically clean leather towards the rest of her outfit, what appears to be a slung-over sheath and a very large bladed weapon, larger than your falchion, affixed to her back.
 MARISHA: I just like how everyone says 'falchion’.
 LIAM: It’s pronounced 'felching’.
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: I’m going to pick up my cards in a very specific order very quickly and start stacking the deck.
 ASHLEY: All right, well. If you want to follow me, I’ll take you to your seats and I’ll stand beside you the whole time.
 TRAVIS: Fucking lead the way.
 TALIESIN: Hey, Jester. Before you go. Tiefling to tiefling, and thank you for keeping this rabble in check.
 LAURA: Of course, you know, they’re a lot to handle.
 TALIESIN: One on the house. And I pull two cards.
 LAURA: Yes? What are you telling me?
 TALIESIN: I pull the Moon and I pull the Shadow. Does this mean anything to you?
 LAURA: Oh, yes.
 TALIESIN: Well, think about it. Put it away.
 ASHLEY: Beau.
 MATT: Both her and the half-orc turn to you.
 ASHLEY: Little one. I just go over and I fireman-style over my shoulder. Since you can’t walk.
 MARISHA: Oh.
 (laughter)
 MATT: Just carries her right in. Perfect.
 MARISHA: I turn back to the rest of them.
 TALIESIN: Such grace! Such form! Such dignity!
 TRAVIS: The birds are out already.
 MATT: At which point, the other Bo, Bo the Breaker, goes ahead and collects five copper from each of you as you pass through, so mark off five copper, except for the two of you, you guys are part of it.
 LAURA: If I skip around, will I be part of the show and then I don’t have to pay?
 TALIESIN: Weirdly, being part of the show means you strangely pay more. I’m not entirely sure how that works.
 LIAM: Nott, do you have five copper?
 SAM: For you, Caleb, I do.
 LIAM: No, I’m not asking. I was going to help you, but if you have it, you’re good.
 SAM: No, you’ve been spotting me all day, I’ll take care of both of us.
 ASHLEY: Mollymauk. That Jester’s adorable.
 TALIESIN: I know. Highly entertained.
 ASHLEY: I like her.
 TALIESIN: I do too.
 MATT: So, stepping into the interior of the tent, the rocky floor filled with grass and dirt and various flattened groundscape on the outskirts of the Ustaloch, you can see a thick, heavy tarp-like material hitting the very edge where the heavy dark blue cloth hangs from the sides of the tent you’re within. You can see where the seating is guided across the floor, and there, already in a very packed room, you see a few dozen townsfolk that have begun to gather in a semicircle. There is the entrance flap of the tent where you guys are walking in. As soon as you walk in, you can see a central pillar, a heavy column of wood, a tree that has been completely rounded off on all sides, held aloft to carry the top of the canopy of the tent itself. And across the way, you can see a larger flap tent that is currently closed that appears to be probably the performers’ entrance. You can see above you four hanging lanterns that glow with what seems like a flicker of light, but the pattern to them is consistent, meaning it’s not probably natural flame. Children and people are beginning to mash around the sides, and the space along the edges of the interior of this tent is starting to get a little cramped. Where do you guide them, Yasha?
 ASHLEY: Did you guys want to sit in the front row?
 SAM: That’s what we were told is the best seat in the house.
 ASHLEY: We want to sit in the front row.
 MATT: So there’s– if you consider a semicircle pattern here, there’s– if you’re entering, you can go front to the right, front to the left, front to the center, anywhere in between. Where would you like to be currently sitting?
 ASHLEY: Front and center? Or do you want to be on the sides?
 LAURA: Front and center!
 ASHLEY: I take them to the front and center.
 MATT: Front and center, okay.
 LIAM: I’m going to keep my hand on my meager purse for the evening.
 MATT: Okay.
 LAURA: As soon as I sit down, I’m going to pull out my sketchbook and draw the moon and the shadow card that Molly showed me.
 MARISHA: As we’re walking over, I say, hey, Yasha, 'cause I was totally on your shoulder, heard you talking about my friend, Jester.
 ASHLEY: Ah, shit.
 MARISHA: Yeah.
 ASHLEY: I didn’t mean anything by it. I just–
 MARISHA: No, dude. No, she’s never mentioned a significant other, so, I mean.
 ASHLEY: Oh, I’m not looking for anything, I just–
 MARISHA: Will you hold me through the show?
 (laughter)
 MARISHA: Like, cradle me?
 ASHLEY: That’s an extra charge. We do do that, though.
 MARISHA: How much?
 ASHLEY: Well, it’s an extra five gold pieces.
 MARISHA: Five gold?
 ASHLEY: These arms are worth a lot.
 TALIESIN: It’s a very swaddling hug. You’ve never experienced anything like it.
 ASHLEY: It’s the best way to see the show, if that’s how you want it.
 MARISHA: I’ll give you five silver just to have your shrug to sit on so my butt’s not on the floor.
 ASHLEY: I don’t take off my shrug.
 MARISHA: Oh, sorry.
 ASHLEY: How about you just keep your money and I’ll put you in a chair and I’ll just watch over your weapons.
 MARISHA: Okay.
 MATT: So she places you on the ground, as there are no chairs.
 ASHLEY: On the ground, I mean, because there’s no chairs.
 LAURA: Oh, there’s no chairs? Aw. I was picturing benches. That’s okay.
 TRAVIS: There’s no benches? Oh, fuck.
 MATT: Where are they going to transport benches from place to place?
 ASHLEY: That’s a good point.
 TRAVIS: Carnival? I don’t know.
 (laughter)
 MATT: Well, sorry, you have Fletching and Moondrop to deal with.
 TALIESIN: Bring a cushion from home like a regular person.
 MATT: So, as the music has died down and everyone begins to crowd in and whisper to themselves, eventually it begins to quiet a bit, everyone having their seats. The familiar sound of the fiddle begins to play, and everyone quickly gets quiet, down to a hush. The music seems sourceless in the interior of the tent. Everyone begins to look around to see where it may come from. You hear points of hushed “look"s, pointing off in different areas, and at the top of the tent, you see, seeming to stretch and fall, like a slow drop of water, the man in red you saw earlier descends from the top of the tent, but now dressed head-to-toe in a matching deep blue outfit and full makeup, to where he appears out of the canopy of the tent. He hangs from a rope by one foot, it’s wrapped around and clutched as his foot catches the edge. Playing his violin ever-so-slowly as he carefully descends, and then at the last moment releases the rope and lands on his feet, continuing the music he’s playing. He slowly spins as the longer-haired elf leader of the earlier parade that you saw, the one that had marked back briefly to your two new friends over here, enters the tent from the distant flaps, the performers’ entrance, his head now sporting that same tall hat, flopping backwards at the apex. He extends his arms, removing the hat, and takes a deep bow as the crowd begins to clap.
 (applause)
 MATT: "Ladies and gentlemen of Trostenwald, I am Carnival Master Gustav Fletching, and allow me to welcome you to the Fletching and Moondrop’s Traveling Carnival of Curiosities.”
 (applause)
 MATT: “I ask you, each and every one of you–” You hear some children giggle as he makes eye contact. –grant us your imaginations this eve but a trifle bit of time, and allow us to reveal a realm of laughter, mystery, danger, and beauty. I see you’ve already met Desmond.” And he gestures towards the man in all blue who’s playing the fiddle. “He’ll be part of our story tonight, so keep a wily eye for the shifting fool. But first, I tell you a tale of two sisters of the Fey.” And as Desmond slowly leaves the tent, you see two armored guards by where he is now have entered, two of the Crown’s Guard are stepping by the entrance where he walked in, watch him pass. “Lost without form into the mazes of the underworld. There, where the body would break, they found a teacher in a mystical serpent, and the gift they received was the ability to bend with this maze that captured them and slither their way back to the surface to reclaim their place in the world. May I present to you Mona and Yuli, the Knot Sisters.” As he slowly backs through the performers’ entrance, the two halfling dancers you saw earlier, in the full bodysuits, emerge from behind the Carnival Master as he discreetly exits. They sport serpentine makeup, scales affixed to the sides of their face and arms. Approaching the central spire, the pole that holds the tent up, one immediately leaps onto the shoulders of the other, bending her back a near-impossible amount, creating this humanoid sculpture that you see the front row cringe at the idea of the pain that would cause an average individual. But these halflings are very nimble and able to create almost a single form out of two bodies. Their rigid form becomes fluid to the eye as they move and shift to the music, the violin now sourceless once again, not seeing where this Desmond is placed, but they seem to move as it picks up speed.
 LAURA: (whispers) It’s like the serpent we fought, you guys!
 SAM: I was expecting more Ringling Brothers, actually.
 (laughter)
 MATT: Suddenly, the top one folds over and slams into the ground, tumbling across the center in a wild display of physical control. The two of them begin to tangle and wrap like two battling snakes, their bodies seemingly disconnecting from the rigid halfling forms you had seen, and you swear, for a moment, becoming serpentine-like as they intertwine around the base of this pole. It’s beautiful and violent at the same time. It’s off-putting. And watch as they curl around the base of this pole, the lights above begin to become a dull greenish-blue, and get darker and darker, presenting this imagery of the underworld. One by one, they silently tell a tale of struggle, crawling across one, then the other, one at a time, using their serpentine-like forms as an extending ladder, folding over each other as they use every muscle in their body to cling around this pole and ladder-step up like a snake. It’s a very strange but alluring sight, and you can’t help but notice that you forget that these are two halfling girls, and you find yourself pulled into this wordless story they tell of climbing back to their place, to the surface, towards the dark sky of lightless blue cloth. As the baubles that contain the interior light of the tent begin to glow brighter and brighter, their climbing becomes more fevered. The two of them, arm into arm, leg into leg, rolling up and swirling, until eventually at the apex they grab each other’s arms around the pole before spinning downward, back-to-back, legs outward, with a rapid pace, the music coming to a full crescendo. Like a Maypole, they both curl and twirl and then tumble to the ground before the audience with a flourish, arms in the air, and the audience erupts in applause.
 (applause)
 MATT: As they both begin to back away, smiles on their faces, nodding to each other, Gustav emerges once more from the performers’ flap. The fool appears at the back entrance again, taking an ominous tune with his violin this time, his outfit no longer blue but deepset black. The hanging lights darken once again as Gustav takes the center stage. “In a flash, beyond the ash, the gods all went and gone. The darkness came to grasp, reclaim, and suffocate the dawn.” Suddenly, out of the darkness behind him, a burst of flame lights the room. “But from that night, a burning light doth keep back shadows’ bane. The strength
to fight will set alight the morning sun again. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Ornna the fire fairy.” And Gustav leaves the tent once more. As you watch, a pair of metallic fans, alight with flame, now frame the beautiful woman of short red hair you had seen before in the procession. Gustav slinks into the darkness and vanishes as Ornna spins in hypnotic twirl, her simple dress of golds and reds almost glowing in the firelight around her, the flickering of the flames giving her the visage of a warrior-goddess battling the dark that surrounds. The frenzied fiddle of the fool picks up as she twirls the fans in her grasp, her face stoic and graceful simultaneously. The hushed awe of the audience fills the air, watching this magnificent warrior strike at the shadows, the lights above flickering brighter with each spin and dive, banishing the shadows from the room. She matches the pace of the music, drawing to a crescendo, and leaps, and barrel-turns and climaxes with her striking a powerful pose as the lights rocket to a victorious luminescence. Once again, the crowd goes crazy.
 (applause)
 LAURA: This is really different than most carnivals that I’ve gone to.
 SAM: It’s very artistic, yeah.
 MATT: Gustav enters as she exits with a bow, the fans flickering out. He enters clapping at Ornna. A low drumbeat begins to beat in the distance as the fiddle grows tense once more. “Even as the sun would rise anew, bellowing roars will quake the lands of Xhorhas and beyond. Terrible beasts, now freed from their dark masters, scattered into our world.” (roars) A terrible, guttural roar shakes the room, followed by the sounds of grinding and dragged chains. From behind the performers’ flap, the half-orc, Bo, who you’d met earlier, the Breaker, and the fool, who is now still playing the fiddle, yet the bow of it continues to go on its own as he drags the other chain with his arm, wrapped around his forearm. The two of them pull something through the flap. It swells, and from beneath it is revealed an enormous creature of green scales, slimy-looking skin, and a corpulent form, large toad-like legs frame a rotund torso, and muscular arms that are manacled and pulling him in. It fights and wrestles against the taut chains as it’s pulled further and further towards the center of the tent, but is held in place by the two men. It roars a second time. (roars) The front row immediately pulling back and screaming. You hear kids begin to cry. A handful of townsfolk shoot to their feet, grasping the children in fear, preparing to run.
 LAURA: Have we ever seen anything like this before?
 MARISHA: Yeah, what’s it look like?
 LAURA: Well, he just described what it looked like.
 MARISHA: By name.
 MATT: You have not seen this creature. Gustav continues, seemingly unflinched by its approach. “The devil-toad crawls hungrily–”
 SAM: But what does it look like?
 (laughter)
 MATT: “–into the land of the free folk, lording over nightmares as they say, and what truth lies behind the eyes of this beast? What would be learned when the guiding heart of innocence pierces the hateful soul and brings it to see beauty for the first time? I present to you the vivid voice of Toya.” And as Gustav backs away, the devil-toad struggling against the chains, a soft, faint voice begins to slowly emanate from the air–
 (a voice appears in the background music)
 (exclamations)
 MATT: Eyes previously locked on the frightening creature now seek a source and find, atop a platform within the chamber, high up on a small platform set against the apex of the pole, a young dwarven girl, maybe 12 years of age, her braided golden hair clasped and her hands at her side, a white dress obscuring her feet. She sings with a mystifying, mature voice that pierces your hearts with joy, unexpectedly and uncontrollably. The crowd audibly gasps as one, the entrancing song of this girl bringing every person into this music. The devil-toad stops struggling against the chains, seemingly caught by the sound of her voice. Its face drops into a soft smile as it slowly walks towards the base of the pole and sits. The half-orc and the fool drop the chains and back away, leaving the beast free in its rapture. Her voice almost begins to summon a chorus from the ether, magical in nature, as there are no others but her joining into this piece. Her smile is infectious, and you can’t tear your eyes away. You only now realize the tears down your cheeks, but you cannot break your gaze. From the front row of the audience, on the left, a man stands up, his arms outstretched towards her. His dirtied cloak falls away, his face and skin wracked with age. You see his legs shaking as he stands, his cheeks wet with tears. He shouts (exclaims). His arms drop and clutch his chest. Gurgles a burst of vocal pain once more, and folks nearest to him begin to lean away as he begins to shake. You glance over as the old man yells out once more, as the skin on his arms suddenly begins to tear, the bones splitting from the flesh, writhing, cracking. Dust and blood shake from his wounds as his form swells. Screams begin to ring out from the audience around him, people rising up and running for the exit. Chaos breaks into the room around you. Toya’s song abruptly ends, the little girl looking down with fright in her eyes, the devil-toad glancing about worriedly, the half-orc and the fool rushing up beside him to look at the transforming man. The half-orc yells, escorting patrons to the exit, “Everyone! Leave the tent now! Kylre–” As he points to the devil-toad. “–get her to safety.” The devil-toad glances up and leaps with a sudden gust of strength to the top and grabs the center pole of the room as it begins to almost quiver to his weight. He grabs the little girl safely under his arm and leaps back down. What are you all doing?
 LAURA: I invoke Duplicity.
 MATT: You watch as her form suddenly dissipates into multiple seemingly copies of her form as Jester.
 TRAVIS: Yasha? We’re going to need those weapons back.
 MARISHA: I turn to Mollymauk and go, man, I thought it was kind of lame at first, but this is awesome!
 TALIESIN: Everyone get out right now.
 MARISHA: This isn’t part of the show?
 TRAVIS: Not part of the show.
 SAM: It’s too artsy.
 MATT: The old man’s body stops quaking, his flesh now grey and mangled like an ancient tree trunk. He turns, his eyes blood-red and bulging, his lips curled into a horrifying grimace. The two Crown’s Guard begin to try and make their way through the panicked crowd, but the people, like a wave of chaos, are keeping them at bay. I need everyone to roll initiative.
 (yelling)
 LIAM: The miniatures come out, guys!
 TRAVIS: First map!
 (yelling)
 MARISHA: I rolled a natural one.
 SAM: That bodes well.
 MATT: So you guys, this guy is actually over here. You guys are all up here in the front.
 LAURA: Oh yeah, we were right in the fucking front row. Look at us! We’re so cute!
 TALIESIN: Oh my god, it’s so pretty.
 SAM: We’re all going to die.
 LIAM: Probably. But then the third campaign begins.
 LAURA: Yay.
 SAM: I like the tents and donkeys outside. Amazing.
 MARISHA: Look, Taliesin, it’s a bardo. Oh my god!
 TALIESIN: No, go for it. Oh boy.
 MATT: All right, so. 20 to 15?
 LAURA: 21.
 MATT: All right.
 LAURA: Oh, wait, 22.
 MATT: Nice. 15 to ten?
 TALIESIN: Ten.
 SAM: Ten.
 TRAVIS: 12.
 ASHLEY: 13.
 LIAM: 11.
 MATT: So 13 and then ten and ten? Sorry, 12. So Yasha got 13, then we have Fjord. And then 11. And then we have Nott at ten. And what’d you get?
 MARISHA: Five. Rolled terribly.
 MATT: There we go. Okay, so. Top of the round, as this creature turns and glares about in the area, this swollen form over here to the side, that’s what remains of the old man who had stood up in the center of the chamber. Jester, you’re up first.
 LAURA: Okay. Well, I’m just going to go for it, all right? I’m going to cast Guiding Bolt on the monster that just appeared.
 MATT: Okay, as it turns towards you. It’s a saving throw, correct?
 LAURA: Let’s find out. You make a ranged spell attack.
 MATT: Go ahead and roll on that.
 LAURA: Okay, okay.
 SAM: Magic, you’re using magic.
 LAURA: Well, it’s cocked. It was 20 and then it rolled.
 SAM: You said cocked.
 LIAM: You’re a cock.
 LAURA: That’s 11 plus– what do I add to my– Guiding Bolt, plus five. So 16.
 MATT: 16 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
 LAURA: Yay. 4d6.
 MATT: Yasha, you’re almost on deck.
 LAURA: Ten, 16, 18, and then any attacks in the future– the next attack has advantage.
 MATT: How much damage was that? 2d6, 18?
 SAM: 4d6, you said.
 LAURA: Yeah, it was 4d6 radiant damage. So yeah, it was 18. And then I’m going to run the opposite direction away from him, but I’m going to keep my duplicate up there.
 MATT: Okay, which, for your duplicate, I should go ahead and grab something.
 TALIESIN: Oh, you’ve got toys.
 LAURA: That backpack’s almost as big as my dice bag.
 MATT: Almost. I was like, that’s right, you can do this, so I need to pull out– we’ll say for the purposes of this, you’re– we’ll put you– this will be your duplicate, wherever you want to move it from where you are, so she moves there.
 LAURA: So she’s going to stay here. I can’t reach that far, but. Oh, shit, sorry.
 MATT: Just let me know where. There?
 LAURA: Sorry, I didn’t realize it was–
 MATT: You can get there.
 LAURA: Okay, sounds good.
 MATT: Okay, so that ends your turn. At the top of your turn, this creature closest to one of the people nearby screaming, this young woman who’s trying to back away, it just turns toward her and grabs and tries to tear into her with two strikes. The first one, that is actually going to miss. She ducks out of the way and begins crawling across the ground as it goes for a second attack. That, however, does hit, it’s a 16. That’ll do it. So with eight points of bludgeoning damage, it reaches down and slams its fist into her chest, and as it does, she gives out this horrible yelp as it rips into her and begins gnawing into her flesh and pulls away with a mouthful of it and stands up, its eyes scanning the room for the next possible victim. It’s going to begin to stalk forward, coming up to that guy. All right, Yasha, your turn.
 ASHLEY: Okay. How close am I to them– I want to give them their weapons.
 MATT: You’re right there. You’d have to– You’re pretty close to everybody. You could distribute– you could use your action to toss the weapons out to everybody this turn, I’ll say.
 ASHLEY: Okay. I’ll pass my weapons out this turn.
 MATT: Okay, so you’ll spend your action throwing them out to the individuals. So your shortsword and crossbow clatter to the ground, and you quickly scramble to grab them. Caleb’s dagger falls at his foot. Your staff gets tossed quickly from behind you. Your falchion meets your arm.
 SAM and MARISHA: Falchion.
 MATT: All right. That ends Yasha’s turn. Fjord, you’re up.
 TRAVIS: Can I run up with the falchion within melee?
 MATT: You actually rush through Jester’s form. You watch the image dissipate as you charge through it and meet up, face-to-face, with this large, gnarled, horrible-looking creature. What are you doing?
 TRAVIS: Ripping the falchion, can I swing it into the creature?
 MATT: You may.
 LAURA: And you get advantage.
 TRAVIS: I do? Thank god, because that was a one. 18.
 MATT: 18 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
 TRAVIS: Nice.
 SAM: It’s a real fight!
 MATT: Yeah.
 TRAVIS: 11.
 SAM: We’ve got like a dozen hit points, we’ll be okay.
 MATT: All righty. That ends your turn? All right, you’re done. That brings us to Caleb.
 LIAM: I would like to use my movement to push as far into the crowd as I can.
 MATT: Okay, going through the crowd is–
 LIAM: Half-movement? That’s fine, sure. I just want people in front of me.
 MATT: Push through to about there. You end up pushing a kid out of the way.
 LIAM: That’s great. That’s exactly fine with me and I will pull out the diamond and cast Chromatic Orb, and I will send a ball of cold at the creature that Fee-ord – Fjord –
 MATT: All right, go ahead and make a spell attack.
 LIAM: Yes, here it comes.
 SAM: Watch out for Fee-ord.
 (laughter)
 LIAM: My goodness. That is a 17.
 MATT: 17 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
 LAURA: Isn’t Chromatic Orb like a really strong spell?
 LIAM: No.
 MATT: There’s Prismatic Spray. Chromatic is the starter version.
 LIAM: That is nine.
 ALL: Nein!
 MATT: (German accent) All right, very well done, Caleb.
 LIAM: (thicker German accent) Now is the part where we dance.
 MATT: So as you push the child out of the way, turn, putting your pocketed diamond out in front of you, you focus and you watch as this beam of light blue energy streaks past, just barely coasting between a few heads. It slams into this creature, as crystals form where the wound and impact was. It cracks back into place where it was. End of your turn? All right. Nott, you’re up.
 SAM: Okay. Having seen the beautiful dwarven– girl, was it? Who sang and soothed a monster earlier in the show, I’m going to attempt to sing and soothe this monster. So I step forward and I open my mouth, and I sing, (singing badly) And I will always soothe you!
 LAURA: Can I shoot an arrow at Nott?
 LIAM: He’s killing the memory of Scanlan.
 MARISHA: I know, can’t let that go.
 MATT: Make a performance check.
 SAM: Performance check. Ooh, it’s really good. 18, minus three, so that’s 15.
 MATT: Okay. As you’re singing out this discordant sound, folks nearby are covering their ears and glancing back and looking in surprise at this strange creature giving off this–
 SAM: Does it die?
 MATT: No. However, it now, after taking a few hits nearby, its red eyes– or at least one red eye slips over to look in your direction. That’s as much of an effect.
 SAM: Fuck!
 (laughter)
 MATT: Do you want to move, or are you going to stay there?
 SAM: Yes, I’m going to move, and I’m going to dash behind somebody in the crowd, some weak-looking individual.
 MATT: Okay. You can get behind there. Okay. All right, that ends your turn?
 LIAM: That’s our M.O., baby!
 MATT: Beau, you’re up.
 MARISHA: Oh shit, okay. To RP my tragic one on the first fucking battle a little bit, I’ll turn to everybody and go, guys, no, it’s part of the show. Molly said that people die. She was just a claque. Okay. And then I run and I’m going to tackle the zombie guy. Can I see if I can grapple him?
 MATT: You can certainly, on the first attack. Go for it. Make an athletics check.
 MARISHA: Just straight athletics. Oh god. Do I keep that? It’s not good.
 (laughter)
 MARISHA: Seven.
 MATT: 17. You attempt with your first strike, and the creature just breaks away. Its strength is far more than you imagined it would be from what was originally an elderly-looking frame.
 MARISHA: I go, oh, fuck that. I don’t know if that’s true, and I’m going to do a flurry of blows and do two, pop-pop. That’s unarmed, right? Pop-pop.
 MATT: That is correct.
 MARISHA: I do two, right?
 MATT: Yes, if you’re using your ki point to do that, yes.
 MARISHA: Yes, I am. So first one, it’s plus six? Okay. First one is 19. No, 20. First one is 20 total, and then the second one is 15 total.
 MATT: Both hit. Roll damage for each.
 MARISHA: Okay. Not great.
 SAM: What are those dice?
 MARISHA: They’re d4s, they’re just fancy d4s. Yeah. That is four, eight, 11 points of damage.
 MATT: Between both? Great. So after the grapple fails and it pushes you away, you go ahead and pull back and then leap, kick it in the chest and then uppercut it in the chin.
 MARISHA: Yeah, that’s cool.
 MATT: Looks back towards you. So that would be putting you up base-to-base with it there. All righty. Ending your turn? Okay, at that point, the crowd is now screaming and begins to swell and push in this direction. These folks all begin to run back and around this way. This crowd begins to push, the guards are trying to push forward, and they can only get a little ways forward to there and there. Everyone just shifts out this direction.
 LAURA: God, somebody’s going to get trampled.
 SAM: It’s really a hazard. They should have had more exits.
 LAURA: I mean, it’s a fire hazard, for sure.
 MATT: Caleb and Nott, I need you both to make dexterity saving throws.
 SAM: 15.
 LIAM: Oh, pretty good. That is 17 for me.
 MATT: All right. You both manage to just bob and weave through the crowd to prevent being trampled and backing away from the chaos as people are pushing through. The entrance is too small for everyone to leave, and there’s now a giant bottleneck that’s beginning to push up as people are now screaming and trying to get out. They’re crying, and the chaos is just swelling into this absolute cacophony. As soon as that finishes, the devil-toad carrying the dwarven girl, who was given a decree, exits out back with her to get her to safety. These two begin to slowly back away, seeing that things seem to be handled? And the guards making their way in are looking scared at each other, not really knowing what to make of the current chaos. At that point, you watch as the woman whose chest was torn into by this creature suddenly–
 (groaning)
 MATT: –snaps up into place.
 LAURA: Oh, shit. Okay, we have to keep them from being dead.
 MATT: Top of the round. Jester, you’re up.
 LAURA: Oh, god.
 MATT: What was your initiative again?
 TALIESIN: Ten.
 MATT: Ten, oh, shit. That’s right, you’re with Nott, that’s what happened. So Molly, you go ahead and go for your turn as well. My apologies.
 TALIESIN: I’m going to yell to the back, open the tent wide! And I’m going to pull– how far away am I?
 MATT: You’re right there. You’re in the middle of the crowd as it’s swarming around you and Yasha.
 TALIESIN: (sighs) I’m going to run around and see if I can flank that creature, if I can move towards flanking that creature with the other two.
 MATT: You can’t really flank it, but you can get next to it.
 TALIESIN: All right. Can I get close enough to take a shot?
 MATT: You can, yeah.
 TRAVIS: Take a shot?
 SAM: You have guns?
 TALIESIN: Well, old habit.
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: As a bonus, I’m flipping it out, and I’m going to activate the first sword.
 MATT: Okay, so you watch as Molly pulls the scimitar out, and as he unsheathes it, draws it across the side of his exposed chest, causing a little bit of blood to spill out, and as it does, he pulls the blade out, and you watch as the edge, suddenly, ice crystals begin to build on the outside of the blade.
 TALIESIN: And I’m taking a shot at the creature.
 SAM: Taking a shot?
 TALIESIN: Taking a slice.
 LAURA: Taking a stab.
 SAM: But with bullets.
 TALIESIN: That’s 21 to hit.
 MATT: That hits.
 TALIESIN: That’s not bad. That’s eight points of damage and one point of ice damage.
 MATT: Okay, so nine points of damage on the first strike.
 TALIESIN: No, that was my bonus.
 MATT: That was your bonus, that’s all you’ve got. Okay. So one strike, you cut across, and you watch as you cut this wide wound open, exposing the fleshy organs’ interior, but they’re frozen where the wound cut through, and it’s still holding it together. It’s looking like it’s starting to hurt a bit and fall apart slightly.
 SAM: This is the bigger monster?
 MARISHA: So it’s the one I’m fighting?
 MATT: Yes. So that ends your turn, Molly? Brings us to the top. So Jester, sorry, back to you.
 LAURA: Oh, now I’m worried. I’m worried about the undead. I don’t know. Well, I don’t think I would know this, so it’s okay. I’m going to say to the air and say, dude, are you here, because this is like the coolest shit we’ve ever seen! And then I’m going to cast Toll the Dead on the first zombie creature guy. And there’s a bell that tolls.
 MATT: Toll the Dead.
 MARISHA: Oh, that’s fucking rad, dude.
 LAURA: He has to make a wisdom saving throw or take 1d12 necrotic damage.
 MATT: Natural one. Go ahead and roll a d12.
 LAURA: Oh, three. That’s lame.
 MATT: Three points of necrotic damage. So as this deep temple bell rings out in the air above, you watch as this creature who has turned and is beginning to just whale upon the surrounding allies that are curling at its sides, it seems to retract from the sound and cover its ears briefly before angrily lashing out.
 LAURA: And I made that sound like it was coming from my duplicate, and my duplicate’s going to run back a little bit and stand next to the pole. Yeah.
 MATT: Cool. Is that your turn? All right. The standing creature that’s now been sliced, bludgeoned, and wounded by all three of you, is going to go ahead and make two strikes at– roll randomly to see who it goes for. That’s going to be at Beauregard. It swings at you twice, both with its giant massive clawed fists, just striking out towards you. First one is 17 to hit?
 MARISHA: My armor class is 17.
 MATT: Nine points of bludgeoning damage as the first one just slams you in the chest. You feel the wind knocked out of you for a brief second. The second swing’s going to come at you. That’s going to be a 20 to hit.
 MARISHA: Yup, yup, that hits.
 TRAVIS: This thing’s swinging hard. Holy shit.
 MATT: And that’s going to be six points of bludgeoning damage to you.
 LIAM: What are you at, girl?
 MARISHA: Don’t worry about it. I’m bad.
 MATT: It slams into you once with the fist, and the other one grabs into your stomach, abdomen region, and the claws dig in, and its jaw unhinges and drops like a snake’s.
 MARISHA: I turn to Fjord and I go, I’m not a claque, this show’s bullshit.
 MATT: The other one is going to rush over towards you, Mollymauk, as you’re the closest one to it, and is going to take one swing at you.
 TALIESIN: Yeah, no. I’m going to use Blood Maledict.
 MATT: Okay, so you’re using a reaction? You don’t have to roll anything for it. He just has disadvantage on the strike.
 TALIESIN: Oh, that’s right, because I’m not doubling it up.
 MATT: That’ll do it. He rolled a 16 and then a four. So as it swings towards you, you watch as suddenly the reddish burning eyes of the second creature go black, and it goes way too wide and misses you. You easily duck out of the way of its first strike. As it runs past, towards you this way, you get an attack of opportunity as it leaves your attack range to attempt to swing around Molly for a second strike. Go for it.
 TRAVIS: That is 16.
 MATT: 16 hits! Go ahead and roll damage.
 TRAVIS: Nice. That is 12 points of damage.
 MATT: With this brief opening as it rushes past Mollymauk, after its eyes go black, you watch as it stumbles, its vision ruined. With that moment, you swing out with your– falchion, thank you. Yeah, it’s falchion, that’s right– and strike across the back of its shoulder. You see what once was this beautiful young woman is now this swollen, horrible undead form lumbering past, and you cut a heavy chunk of meat off of its shoulder. It curves around and makes a second strike at you, Mollymauk. This one without advantage. That’s a natural 19. Yeah, that’s a 24 to hit. All right. You take eight points of bludgeoning damage, as the first one, you manage to move out of the way, and as you spin your scimitar around, you glance over just in time to have it clock you right across the jaw. Your vision blurs and doubles for a second. That’s going to end their turn. Yasha, you’re up.
 SAM: All right, Yasha!
 ASHLEY: Can I get to the big beast? Beast number one? Okay, so this is the first time I’ve done this, so hopefully I won’t do this wrong. I would like to rage.
 (cheering)
 ASHLEY: I’m going to workshop it, I’ll make something later. For now, it’s a placeholder. Okay, I would like to rage, and reckless attack?
 MATT: Yeah, you can reckless attack any of your attacks.
 SAM: Is that something you can do right away? That sounds like a later thing.
 ASHLEY: Is that something you do later? Okay. I didn’t get a practice shot at this. Okay. So I just roll.
 MATT: You roll at advantage.
 ASHLEY: I don’t know how to play DandD anymore! I just forgot how to do it.
 LAURA: Okay, but roll again, you have advantage.
 ASHLEY: Oh, reckless. Okay. 17?
 MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
 ASHLEY: I take out my beautiful greatsword.
 MATT: Freshly purchased. In fact, this is the first time it’s seen battle.
 ASHLEY: It is the first time it’s seen battle.
 SAM: Google reported a weird influx of 'falchion’ searches.
 (laughter)
 ASHLEY: 13.
 MATT: On the one that’s already been damaged?
 ASHLEY: Yeah. The first guy.
 MATT: Yeah, all right.
 ASHLEY: Get the fuck out of my tent!
 (laughter)
 MATT: Yeah, no, it does not make the save– it rolled– yeah. So as you come down with your blade and carve through its body, you watch as it curls back, trying to reform and hold itself, but your blow was too strong, and its zombie-ish form cannot maintain a cohesive hold on its form, and you watch as it just crumbles to the ground, no longer moving.
 (cheering)
 SAM: Yasha!
 ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.
 MATT: Okay, that ends your turn. As you’re there, growling animalistically towards the creature.
 ASHLEY: Ooh, that feels fun.
 MATT: You have about five more feet of movement, if you wanted to move.
 ASHLEY: Okay, so I’m going to go a little bit closer to– wait, how many more are left? Just the other one? Yeah, so I’ll get ready for the other one. So a little bit closer to it.
 MATT: All right. That ends your turn, Yasha. Fjord, you’re up.
 TRAVIS: Shit. I’ll turn and head towards other tree-zombie fuck. I would like to use my bonus action to cast Hex on it.
 MATT: Okay. So you watch as Fjord lumbers towards it, his large, armored half-orc form holding the blade in his hand. Puts his hand out, and the shadows suddenly swirl and gather around this zombified woman’s form and cling to it, like it’s holding it in place. So with it now hexed, what would you like to do?
 TRAVIS: I would like to use my falchion to open it the fuck up.
 MATT: All right, go for it.
 TRAVIS: 21.
 MATT: That definitely hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
 TRAVIS: That’s 12 points of damage, plus five points of necrotic damage.
 MATT: 17 points of damage.
 LIAM: Level two, that’s major.
 MATT: So, as you rush up, after the shadows gather around it, it looks up to you, and it pulls back, ready to strike, and you just shake your head, and one large swipe of your falchion carves this giant mark across its chest. Where the cloth and flesh opens, you can see this blackened interior, where the muscles are trying to move, almost like worms, to regather and tighten. All right, that ends your turn. That brings us to Caleb.
 LIAM: All right, I know that it’s restricted movement, but I will push this way through the crowd so that I have a clearer shot, as far as I can, and then I will re-up with Chromatic Orb.
 MATT: You can push right about there. You just barely pull through the crowd to the front to get a clear–
 LAURA: Hi, Caleb.
 LIAM: I certainly don’t want to do that. I want to stay in the crowd, behind people, and I will do Chromatic Orb again, but this time, I’m going to set it to acid, so see if it hit. Oh, that’s not good, it’s 11.
 MATT: 11 unfortunately does not hit. So as you pull it out a second time, you’re pushing through the crowd and you pull up your diamond, and right as you’re about to release the spell, one of the people in the crowd slams into you with her shoulder and you get jarred off to the side. The acid bolt of the Chromatic Orb flies off and actually burns a hole through the distant tent and then vanishes into the night sky.
 LIAM: Hope that didn’t hit anyone.
 MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Caleb. Nott, you’re up.
 SAM: Do I have eyes on the biggie? Is Fjord right next to her?
 MATT: Fjord and Mollymauk are both next to it, yes.
 SAM: All right. I’m going to peek out behind whatever patron I’m next to, take out my little crossbow and just shoot a little shot.
 MATT: All right, go for it.
 TRAVIS: Is it made of piano wire?
 (laughter)
 SAM: 16.
 MATT: 16 hits.
 LAURA: I like how every time you roll it comes out.
 SAM: It does. This is very bouncy. Okay, so 1d6, that’s a four, plus four is eight, plus I get sneak attack damage, 'cause I’m a rogue. Another four, so that’s 12. Is the creature bigger than me? I will use Fury of the Small.
 (cheering)
 SAM: To inflict another two points of damage, so that’s 14 points of damage.
 MATT: Okay. As you pull around the corner and release your one crossbow bolt, it hits the bottom of the chin and pokes out one of the eyes. The eye goes flying off into the distance as the bolt is now jammed outside of the socket. The creature turns, glancing your direction. It looks pretty hurt, but it’s still standing.
 SAM: Can I use the rest of my action-movement-whatever bonus to look at the patron I’m next to. Do they have any baubles or jewelry on them?
 TRAVIS: In this moment?
 MATT: I’ll say you can use your bonus action to just look. There’s nothing you can do this turn, but next turn, you could. So make a perception check.
 SAM: Oh, it’s just nine.
 MATT: Nine? It’s hard to look. You see this what looks to be late-30s woman dressed in some sort of general workers’ clothing with a loose apron, and she’s just running and scrambling to get towards the exit. You don’t see anything of worth on her, unfortunately. Sorry. All right, Nott, that ends your turn. Molly, you’re up.
 TALIESIN: I’m still engaged with it, right? Okay, I’m going to take two swipes.
 MATT: Okay, so you spin around. You pull your second scimitar out, as part of the strike, one of them encased in ice crystals. So the first strike– make sure you mark which one’s which.
 TALIESIN: Purple’s the ice. That’s– the purple is 12 to hit?
 MATT: 12 just barely hits.
 TALIESIN: Ooh. So they both hit, so that’s good. So that’s going to be– or all three, then, because
the other one is 21 to hit.
 MATT: That hits, yeah.
 TALIESIN: The first one is four points of damage.
 MATT: Four points of damage?
 TALIESIN: I’m sorry, the magic one is six points plus three ice, so nine points.
 MATT: Nine points of damage, all right.
 TALIESIN: The other one is four points of damage.
 MATT: Okay. So the first strike hits, and as the scimitar carves through, the body snaps and opens, and it snaps back into place, the torso locking back in. The second strike does how much damage?
 TALIESIN: Four points of damage.
 MATT: Yeah. The second one hits again, and you watch as the torso spins off. It looks like only the spinal column is holding it in place, but it’s managing to maintain its structure as it (snarls). That ends your turn.
 TALIESIN: Someone, anyone? Yep.
 MATT: All right, ending Mollymauk’s turn, that brings us to Beau.
 LAURA: Beau, you got this.
 MARISHA: In response to him, I say, I thought you said you didn’t let in the sick!
 TALIESIN: Just kill it!
 MARISHA: I come up and I want to do a flying Superman (impact).
 MATT: Wham! Go for it.
 MARISHA: First one. Okay. 16?
 MATT: That’ll hit. Damage.
 MARISHA: I had my staff– oh, I had my staff, but I said–
 LIAM: You said Superman punch, man.
 MARISHA: It’s fine, it’s fine. Six damage.
 MATT: Six points of damage. Natural 20. You watch as you sock it in the face and the jaw breaks and then snaps back into place. As you land, pulling it back, you can see some of the teeth are actually stuck in your fist as you pull back, they’ve broken off into your knuckles.
 MARISHA: I go, oh, come on. I’m going to use my other ki point to do flurry of blows again, and I’m going to try and punch him in the bridge with the remainder of his teeth.
 MATT: Her teeth, technically, this is the woman that was killed originally.
 MARISHA: Oh. I’ll be like, you were so pretty, too.
 MATT: Go for it. Two more strikes.
 MARISHA: 19 and 18. Natural. And then, okay.
 LAURA: That’s a really pretty dice.
 MARISHA: Eight, 12, 13 damage.
 MATT: Natural one, no. So the second punch, you swing wide and hit the side of the head, and the neck snaps, and it’s now stuck in a sideways position. As it turns, the jaw, it pulls back one of its weirdly swollen clawed hands, ready to go for that open wound in your gut, and as it does, how do you want to do this?
 (cheering)
 TRAVIS: First one!
 SAM: First blood.
 MARISHA: I’ll do the uppercut with the other one, and the one that has its teeth in it, I want to go right between the bridge of the nose and get the teeth right in the eyes and break the nose bridge into the brain. You know that thing? Yeah.
 MATT: And as you do that, you slam into its face. You watch as the skull caves in, the teeth piercing both of the red, bulging eyes. And with this horrible sucking, sighing sound, it falls onto its back, no longer moving, the shadows released.
 MARISHA: I grab my gash and fucked-up ribs and immediately turn over me. Can I do a perception check or an insight check on any of the ringleaders? On any of what was going on? The ringleader or the jester?
 MATT: That was your turn, unfortunately. That’s your turn. At this point, the current threats are down, and the crowd is screaming and rushing. The two members of the Crown’s Guard are rushed to the front, weapons ready, and they see both of these creatures bloodied and ruined across the base of this. In the midst of the chaos, one of them points and goes, “You, you! Stay where you are!” And you watch as the rest of the crowd slowly pushes through, you see as Gustav manages to make his way in. “Dear god, what’s happened here?” Looks over toward Bo the Breaker, the half-orc who’s now joined the rest of you. “Sir, I don’t know how he got in here.” And everyone looks around back at you. Bo looks at you, Gustav looks to you, Molly. “What happened?”
 TALIESIN: One of them turned. I don’t know what happened.
 LAURA: There was a sick guy! There was an old sick guy and he turned into a zombie! And I run over and I cast Cure Wounds on Beau.
 MARISHA: Oh, thank you, man. I’m really down.
 LAURA: Are you sick too? Did you get hurt? Hold on two seconds. I’m going to cure her and then I’ll cure you too.
 TRAVIS: Yasha, have you ever seen anything like this happen before?
 ASHLEY: No. Never.
 LAURA: Seven points, that’s all I could cure.
 MARISHA: That’s amazing. That’s great.
 TALIESIN: I’m going to drop my sword.
 LAURA: Oh, that’s better for you, ten for you.
 MATT: Okay. At this point, the two Crown’s Guard that are there are trying desperately to maintain control. You can see they’re visibly shaken, and they glance at each other like they’re a little out of their depths at the moment. “Stay where you are. Don’t go anywhere.”
 TALIESIN: Oh, wherever will I go.
 MATT: And he turns to the one who’s in the front, looks to the other one who just made his way through, and goes, “Sivelmen, find someone. Bring the rest of the guard. Please!” “Right now, sir.” And he pushes his way towards the back as the rest of the crowd runs out. Now everyone in the crowd has mostly pushed out of the tent, the last few dregs pushing through. Children crying, people of Trostenwald just exiting out the flaps as they close, and you’re all standing there, weapons in your hands, wondering what to do.
 TRAVIS: What are the corpses doing now that they’ve fallen?
 MATT: They’re both unmoving, ruined, torn apart.
 LAURA: Can I search the corpse of the woman?
 MATT: You can. As you go to move to it, both of your forms merge. The Crown’s Guard goes like, “Don’t move.”
 LAURA: Which one?
 MATT: “Both? Uh.” He looks genuinely confused.
 LAURA: When I’m going “which one?” I make my second form just dart forward and start searching the body.
 MATT: Okay. It mimics searching a body. It’s not actually you. Begins rifling imaginary things out of the pockets.
 LAURA: Look at all the stuff that that one’s finding over there!
 (laughter)
 LAURA: Can he turn and look and I try to search the other guy?
 MATT: Make a deception check to try and deceive him to glance over.
 LAURA: Not bad. 19?
 MATT: (laughs) He goes, “What, over there?” Looks over as you jump over quickly and begin searching through it, and you guys watch her do this, and there’s a clear line of sight. As soon as he turns back, he’s going to notice her rifling through the other corpse.
 ASHLEY: Is Gustav still in here?
 MATT: Gustav is now walking up, and he’s hands up in the air. “I’m terribly sorry. I– this has never happened. I don’t know what happened. What happened?!”
 TALIESIN: We’ve never seen anything like it before. He just– he gripped his heart and fell over and turned into that thing.
 ASHLEY: It was when Toya started singing.
 MARISHA: Yeah, what’s with the dwarven girl? Why–
 TALIESIN: Nothing like this.
 MATT: “She’s been singing with us for over two years, now.”
 MARISHA: How’d she come to you? She’s a pretty young girl.
 MATT: “She had no family and she was singing in the street for change. There was an opportunity. We seized it. We gave her a family she didn’t have.”
 TRAVIS: Put your hands down.
 MATT: The Crown’s Guard goes like (grunts). “It’s fine, just don’t move.”
 LAURA: Did I find anything?
 MATT: Make an investigation check.
 SAM: She uses a different dice for everything, Travis?
 LAURA: Shut up.
 SAM: Is that what I’m dealing with now?
 TRAVIS: You’re not even ready.
 LAURA: 14?
 MATT: You manage to rifle through the old man’s body, through the stringy bits of gore, and you do find three pieces of silver that are just coated in blood. A few moments pass. The rest of the people are gone, and it’s just this awkward quiet, and at this point you watch as Ornna, the fire fairy who had previously performed, walks in and is like, “I’m sorry. What has happened here?”
 LAURA: Your little dwarf girl was singing, and she turns people into zombies.
 TALIESIN: I feel that that was entirely coincidental. I’m really not sure that the two things were related. Something was wrong with this man.
 MARISHA: See, it’s interesting, because I would say the opposite. I would say it wasn’t that coincidental, because–
 LIAM: I would agree, it seemed to happen with this–
 TALIESIN: We’ve seen her sing dozens, hundreds of times. Nothing like this has ever happened. I’ve seen people sit in the front row hundreds of times. Nothing like this has ever happened.
 LIAM: Have you had the elderly or the sick in these tents before?
 MARISHA: Yeah, you also happen to be very explicit on your page that you don’t want the sick, so.
 TALIESIN: Gustav.
 MATT: At this motion, Gustav goes, “It’s generally just because we want to promote a space of welcoming cleanliness. When we’re working amongst the outskirts of the Empire, we don’t want to bring an element that reminds you of death and–”
 SAM: You hate old people so much.
 MATT: “Well, we’re in entertainment. We have to be cautious.” The single Crown’s Guard guy who’s sitting there with his weapon out, you can see him shaking almost, he’s never had to deal with anything like this before.
 TALIESIN: Hold up. I’ve never seen that one before. He looks really suspicious.
 MATT: Towards him?
 TALIESIN: No, the guy behind him.
 LAURA: (gasps) He does look suspicious.
 MATT: Make a deception check.
 TALIESIN: Sure. Eight.
 MATT: He goes, “Don’t try that on me. I’ve been doing this for over ten years.”
 ASHLEY: Oh wait, look at him!
 LAURA: I cast Thaumaturgy and make it sound like there’s a sound coming from behind him, too.
 MATT: Make a sleight-of-hand check to see if you can cast this spell subtly enough or not.
 SAM: This poor guard. Ooh!
 (groaning)
 LAURA: Natural one.
 MATT: As you attempt to cast this spell, a little bit of spittle gets caught in your windpipe, and you begin to cough uncontrollably. Yeah, it just falls away.
 LAURA: (coughing) There was some popcorn that I ate earlier.
 TRAVIS: You should know that whatever happened to that first man when he attacked the woman, she caught whatever he had.
 MATT: “And that is extremely worrying. Nobody touch that body.” And he looks back and sees you coughing over the corpse, and the guy’s like, “Don’t you touch that body! Are you sick?”
 LAURA: (coughing) I have bloody fingers.
 MATT: “Someone hold her down. If she’s sick and turns into one of these, I will not–”
 ASHLEY: She’s fine. Just calm down.
 TALIESIN: Well, we’ve already killed two of them.
 SAM: She’s definitely sick.
 MATT: Make a deception check.
 LAURA: That was cocked, unfortunately. That was a good one. Oh, well. 16?
 MATT: 16? His face goes white and he goes, “Kill the thing!” And rushes forward, blade held above.
 ASHLEY: I take out my greatsword.
 SAM: What, you’re going to kill a guard?
 ASHLEY: Stop, stop.
 MATT: He holds back. He turns to you and sees you standing a full four inches taller than him with a much larger blade, with one hand, and he goes, “Look, if she’s going to become one of these things, we have to stop her now.”
 LAURA: Yasha will totally kill me. Don’t worry, you can leave.
 MARISHA: Jester. Jokes are great until they get you killed, man. She’s joking.
 LAURA: (weak laughter)
 SAM: Poor guard.
 MATT: Immediately rubs his eyes. You can see him, now that he’s closer to you, you can see he’s sweating, he’s scared, he’s generally trying the best he can to use whatever training he’s received to deal with a scenario he was not trained for.
 MARISHA: This is the King’s Guard guy?
 MATT: One of the Crown’s Guard. The Crown’s Guard are all generally hired and trained militia that are sent amongst all the cities to keep the peace.
 MARISHA: What’s your name, man?
 TALIESIN: Wow, he’s really shook up.
 SAM: Jamieson.
 MATT: “Flynn.”
 MARISHA: Flynn. How long you been doing this, you said ten years?
 MATT: “Ten years two months ago.”
 MARISHA: Oh. Happy ten year-i-versary. Yeah, congrats. Did you get a nice watch or like a commemorative tankard?
 TRAVIS: They don’t have watches yet.
 MARISHA: Shit. Did you get a commemorative tankard? Forget the watch part.
 MATT: “No. Don’t move.”
 MARISHA: I’m not moving, man. Hey. Hey, Flynn. Hey, man. How about first we put the swords down, because we helped? Yeah.
 SAM: Are any of us high charisma? 'Cause it don’t seem like it.
 MATT: At this point, the flaps at the front of the tent, the entranceway, fold in and you watch as one, two, three, four, six, ten Crown’s Guard begin filtering into the chamber. You watch as one man, the one who has his helmet off and under his shoulder, he’s maybe in his early 40s or so, short brown hair with patches of grey. Somewhat jaundiced skin. Molly, you’ve encountered this man once before when you entered the city. He approaches Gustav right now with a commanding voice. “I had a gut feeling that you were nothing but trouble when you came into our town.” Gustav turns around. “I guarantee to you, my friend, I have no idea–” “What happened here?” The Crown’s Guard who’s been shaken turns around and goes, “Sir, Flynn. There was a creature. This carnival seemed to create some sort of terrible entity that killed and then created a secondary beast. I watched it with my own eyes from the back row.” And the man turns back towards Gustav and the rest of you. “And who else saw that?”
 TRAVIS: We did.
 LAURA: Well, we saw an old guy turn into a zombie. But it’s possible that he just died because he was old, and then he had the zombie curse on him and just turned, you know? Because that happens a lot.
 TALIESIN: (deadpan) Gustav, it’s no use, we’ve been found out. Our terrible plot to make a zombie rampage through our carnival has been discovered. Whatever will we do now that we’ve been discovered for our brilliant plot to make a zombie ruin our circus. My god.
 MATT: Flynn turns to you and goes, “Put your weapons down or we’ll arrest you immediately!”
 TALIESIN: I’m literally holding nothing but my hands.
 LIAM: I mean, I’m sorry, but we’re basically a group of strangers. Most of us don’t know each other. We all have the same story. There was a show, an old man became a thing, and we helped destroy it. This one destroyed it. What more do you want from us?
 TALIESIN: It ruined our show.
 MATT: Flynn turns back and says, “Watchmaster, what should we do?” And the man with the helmet under his arm walks forward, walks to Gustav, gives him one look over, still a few inches shorter than him. Looks at him with a sense of purpose and social status that has a sense of disinterest and disrespect. “You, sir, and your orc, and your circus, are considered currently under arrest. Who else belongs to your merry band?” He looks about the rest and Gustav goes, “The orc.” Glances back at the two of you and goes, “The rest of them are just purveyors of our performances. He was just joking earlier, right?” Make a deception check.
 SAM: Oh boy.
 TALIESIN: Nope.
 MATT: “And you are also under arrest. The rest of you, what are your names?”
 LAURA: Shirley.
 SAM: Temple.
 (muffled laughter)
 LIAM: Caleb Widogast.
 MARISHA: Beau, same as him.
 TRAVIS: Bo.
 (laughter)
 SAM: I am Bo!
 TRAVIS: You pointed at me.
 MARISHA: I meant the NPC Bo! But it works!
 ASHLEY: Here’s the thing. Oh, it’s Mary by the way, but I think I know who might know what has happened here.
 MATT: “Do you? Tell me.”
 ASHLEY: I’ll have to go get her.
 MATT: “Who is this?”
 ASHLEY: She is the singer that made this all happen.
 MATT: “Flynn, escort this woman to retrieve this individual she speaks of.” Flynn nods and walks over towards you.
 LAURA: She’s really shy, though, and I hear she only talks to tieflings, so you should probably send–
 MATT: “Stay where you are.”
 LAURA: –my brother along, because he’s really good with that stuff.
 TALIESIN: Try not to stab any random people on your way there, Flynn. You’re doing good.
 MATT: “My men tell me that the rest of you helped destroy these fiends. Is that correct?”
 ALL: Yeah.
 MATT: “Then on behalf of the Starosta, I appreciate your aid. But until this investigation is complete, you are all under investigation from us. Where are you staying?”
 TRAVIS: The Nestled Nook Inn.
 SAM: Nested Nook.
 MATT: Nestled. He got it right.
 SAM: Oh, shit. One letter. God damn it.
 TRAVIS: I have an intelligence of 14. I know what I’m doing.
 MATT: “Do not leave this city unless you are told otherwise. Should you do so, I have your names, and I can have the full might of the Cerberus Assembly track you down. You. Flynn. Free this girl.” While you all stand in the tent, Flynn approaches you and walks a little bit behind you, weapon drawn but at the side. Do you lead him out of the tent? Okay. So you walk through the performer’s flap, and as you walk out, you can see backed up into the number of tents that are set up, and some of the carts, other members of the circus are hiding, and as soon as you exit out the front and they see you before the Crown’s Guard, they all immediately scatter and vanish to the nearby shadows, out of sight. The two of you walk out into the center, the fire crackling in a small pit off to the side. “All right, where is this girl you speak of?”
 ASHLEY: She’s in the back in the tents.
 MATT: “Show me.”
 ASHLEY: Follow me.
 MATT: He follows you. Which tent do you lead him to? Over here? Okay, there’s a larger tent, as he walks by your side, there’s the flap that’s slightly open.
 SAM: God, you could seduce him.
 ASHLEY: Go get her. She won’t talk to me. She’s too scared of me.
 MATT: “All right.” Gets his weapon ready and walks into the tent.
 ASHLEY: I close the tent and I take off.
 MATT: Okay. There’s a few moments before, in the distance, you hear a voice say, “The tent is empty. What are you talking about? Hello? Helloooo?”
 (laughter)
 MATT: And you don’t look back, and you just run into the darkness of night, into the Marrow Fields and disappear.
 SAM: But that’s so mysterious.
 LIAM: While that was happening, I’m close to the edge of the tent, and at some point I just (snap) and summoned Frumpkin. I have a 30-feet outside the tent, so Frumpkin’s out there.
 MATT: Okay. Frumpkin keeps watch. The Watchmaster, as you heard him notified earlier, turns to the rest of you. “So. The investigation will begin. If any information comes to light that could alleviate you of the charges brought to this carnival, come to me and let me know. If you have no answers before we complete this investigation, then I believe you all will fall into the judgment.”
 LAURA: Next time we don’t help. That’s what it comes down to.
 MARISHA: I know, we got paid the first time we helped, and then we got arrested the second time. I don’t know what lesson to learn here.
 SAM: Just say okay and let’s leave.
 LIAM: Yeah, yeah.
 MATT: So the guards escort you out of the tent. Molly, you’re stuck behind with Gustav and Bo the Breaker, with a guard of five Crown’s Guards set to keep watch. As the rest of you are sent to the city, the Watchmaster turns once more and says, “Remember, you flee, I’ll find you.” And that’s where we’ll end tonight’s session.
 SAM: No way! What? No! I want to keep playing.
 TALIESIN: I’m so excited, this is great.
 LIAM: It’s a good spot.
 ASHLEY: We did it, we did it.
 TRAVIS: Holy shit.
 LAURA: We have to get Molly out!
 SAM: (sighs) Everything’s better with Molly.
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: Truer words were never spoken.
 MATT: Well, guys, welcome to the new campaign. Season two, I guess.
 LIAM: Oh my goodness.
 MARISHA: It feels so weird.
 SAM: Look at these cool Wyrmwood cases that we have!
 MATT: Fucking Sam. I swear to god.
 MARISHA: I used 100% new dice. No repeats from Keyleth.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, totally new dice.
 TALIESIN: I kept the Gil die.
 LAURA: I used some new dice.
 TRAVIS: What are you talking about?
 LAURA: Some new dice.
 MATT: I used this beautiful little–
 TALIESIN: Fuck you.
 MATT: The Snitch is mine now.
 LIAM: Look at all the 20s Taliesin rolled tonight.
 MATT: I know. Oh man. I’m excited.
 SAM: Such cool characters, guys!
 MATT: I’m excited to see where this goes.
 SAM: I still don’t know what half of you guys are. What’s Travis?
 MATT: Everyone did something that revealed them tonight.
 SAM: I don’t know nothing, I don’t know how to play DandD.
 MARISHA: Should we all say in case you’re Sam and you don’t know?
 TRAVIS: I’m a ballerina.
 MARISHA: He’s a prima.
 MATT: Well, guys. Happy New Year. Welcome back, Happy New Year to you guys. Thank you for coming along with us on this first episode of a new journey. Thank you, Backblaze and DnD Beyond, for being awesome sponsors partnered with us going forward. Thank you, Wyrmwood, for this amazing table. Thank you guys for coming along with us this evening for our first dive into this new venture. Hope you enjoyed it. We did.
 MARISHA: Thank you to our amazing crew.
 SAM: Thank you, Matt Mercer, for this amazing new campaign! Welcome to Wildemount.
 MATT: I’m excited.
 SAM: Thanks, Yev.
 MATT: Guys, have a wonderful evening. We’ll see you next week. See where this next stage in the story takes us. Ashley, I’m glad you could make it for this first episode.
 ASHLEY: Yeah, me too.
 MATT: Until then, have a wonderful night, sleep well, and is it Thursday yet? Good night!

Part I Edit 
 MATT: And welcome back. Last we left off, our slowly gathering band of adventurers had begun to have their stories intertwine in the city of Trostenwold, on the southern reaches of western Wynandir on the continent of Wildemount. Here we had Nott and Caleb who had been traveling southward coming and meeting, in the center of the tavern, the Nestled Nook Inn, with Jester, Beauregard, and Fjord. They were invited to a nearby carnival that had begun preparing for their performance later that evening, in which they met Yasha and Molly. After swapping some stories, earning and losing some gold, they began to gather at the outskirts of the Ustaloch, the lake right on the eastern edge of Trostenwold, for the first opening performance of the Fletching and Moondrop Carnival of Curiosities.
 TALIESIN: Traveling Carnival of Curiosities.
 MATT: Upon entering the tent, they saw a number of performances. However during a musical performance by this young dwarven girl whose voice was this mysterious, magically enchanting experience, a member of the audience rose up and began to transform into a terrible, undead creature, that began to lash out, killing another member of the audience, who then began to become one of these same creatures. You all, grabbing your weapons from Yasha, who had been keeping them stashed away, leapt into the fray, slaughtered both of these terrible beasts, just in time for the crownsguard to rush in, and ask you what the hell happened. After information had been gathered of who was immediately available and responsible for this carnival, Gustav, Bo the Breaker, and Molly were marked to be arrested. One of the guards was escorted outside of the tent by Yasha, who was going to show him where this young dwarven girl was currently resting, and upon being lead astray to the wrong tent, she just ran into the distant hills and vanished. And that is where we left off.
 SAM: So we're still at the carnival?
 MATT: You're still in the tent.
 LIAM: With Crownsgaurd?
 MATT: With the Crownsgaurd and with Watchmaster Jossyd. The crownsguard that had left not but a moment before comes rushing in, his breath huffing, sweat dripping from his brow, his eyes wild. He goes, "Watchmaster! The big woman is gone! She's gone!" The Watchmaster turns to him and says, "You three, go with him. Search for her." They all immediately run out back out the performer's flap and he turns to the rest of you in the group, "Shackle and drag those three down to the stockade." About five guards approach and begin to press Gustav, Bo, and Molly to the ground and begin to put chains and shackles on them.
 TALIESIN: I'd like to make a counter offer?
 MATT: He's in mid-speech, "The rest of you keep an eye on the performers here. Ask around, see what you can find. As for the others, don't go far."
 LAURA: The innocent patrons, you mean?
 MATT: "You may be innocent, in which case you have nothing to worry about. However, we have an investigation to complete, so I would ask that you stay in the city and wait until you are called in. You will be questioned, and when this investigation is completed, regardless of how long it may take, you are not to leave Trostenwald.
 LIAM: If I could just contribute one word, the 40 or so people who are outside and the rest of us will vouch for this one, the colorful one. He saved many people's lives. Don't take my word for it. There's everyone outside.
 MATT: All the rest of the crownsguard glance to each other, he goes, "Well, unfortunately, that is not for me to decide. The Lawmaster would have to be appealed to. If you wish to come with us, we can bring you along with us to the stockade and you can speak with her. Then, perhaps, she may grant you leniency, but I can give you no guarantee."
 MARISHA: Why don't you just question us right now? I'm confused on why you don't just do that now.
 MATT: "Well, we could do that instead. We could have you arrested, put you in the stockade as we question the rest of you."
 LAURA: No, let's go to the stockade.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll all be in one place.
 LAURA: Yeah.
 MARISHA: Jails are not my favored terrain. Just want to point that out. Not this go around. No.
 TRAVIS: Good to know.
 LAURA: I would have guessed that.
 MARISHA: Not really comfortable with that.
 MATT: "We're leaving. The rest of you, stay here. Watch over the performers. Make sure nobody leaves. Come if you wish. Otherwise, we'll be in touch." The Watchmaster gathers alongside the other five crownsguard, lifting up the shackles of the three that had been arrested and begin to drag them outside of the tent and into the night air.
 LIAM: I send Frumpkin to follow.
 MATT: Okay.
 MARISHA: Can I double back into the performance area and see if I can find that little girl that they're looking for? Before they do?
 MATT: You may, if you want to. So you send Frumpkin just follow them. Are you guys staying behind, then?
 TRAVIS: Are there three regular crownsguard that are going with Molly? Or is the Watchmaster going with them as well?
 MATT: The Watchmaster is going with them, or at least he's exiting the tent with them. There looks like there's five crownsguard attending the three of them that are shackled.
 TRAVIS: I'll go out the front exit of the tent just to see if the Watchmaster goes with Molly.
 MATT: Okay.
 LAURA: I'll follow Fjord.
 MATT: Okay, so the two of you are following. Anybody with them? Currently, it's you two and Frumpkin.
 SAM: Are we going with them or not? Should we stay here? This is not our affair, right?
 LIAM: I don't know. I'm having second thoughts about being here at all.
 SAM: Well, you sent the kitty, didn't you?
 LIAM: Yes, and we're not going to leave without him. Why don't we just--?
 SAM: Follow behind a bit?
 LIAM: That's right.
 SAM: Okay. Sounds good.
 MATT: All right, so as you guys exit, keeping apace behind the crownsguard, watching the crownsguard guiding the current prisoners towards the actual city, Frumpkin keeping a zig-zagging distance behind and following.
 LIAM: DM?
 MATT: Yes?
 LIAM: Is it possible for me, if Nott is holding my hand and leading me, to go full third eye and walk blind and deaf here looking through Frumpkin's senses?
 MATT: I would say yes, but you are purely like-- because all you're doing is walking forward and you need someone to guide you.
 LIAM: Right.
 SAM: And he can't communicate to me either so--
 LIAM: I can talk, but I can't hear you. I can talk and hold her hand so she can stop me from prat-falling all over myself. 
 SAM: Yes. But you can talk? 
 MATT: He can talk but he can't hear you.
 SAM: Got it. Okay. Great. 
 LIAM: But we've done this before so you know to squeeze my hand really hard if I should pipe down.
 SAM: Sure. 
 MATT: All right. So, first off, Beauregard.
 MARISHA: Yeah.
 MATT: As you back out of the performer's exit of the tent into the center of their encampment, the immediate exit, there are already four crownsguard currently searching around and setting up a watch perimeter around the different tents. They're gathering and making sure none of the other performers have fled and a lot of them are being brought out into an area where there's a number of tents all facing towards a large campfire in the center. There's a couple of chairs set up there, it's kind of the common area for the performers of the carnival and it looks like they're all being put out there so they can get a beat on it and make sure they know where everyone else is. 
 MARISHA: I'm going to try to be aloof, stealth a little bit. I don't want to make myself completely known.
 MATT: Are you trying to stealth out of sight or just trying to not draw attention?
 MARISHA: No, just try not to draw attention. 
 MATT: Okay, all right. Go and make a stealth check just to see if--
 SAM: Wait, did we just all ditch Marisha?
 LAURA: She just walked out.
 MARISHA: I ditched you. That's cocked. That's better. 17.
 MATT: 17. Okay. As you kind of dart through the flap of the tent and move behind one of the large carts that currently is still affixed to a horse that is currently just chewing on an apple, and you hear the crunch in its teeth, you glance over past the edge of the immediate near tent and you can see this group gathering there and it appears that no one's immediately aware of your presence. 
 MARISHA: Do I see the little girl whose name was-- what was her name?
 MATT: Toya. You do not see her yet. The guard just got out there and they're just beginning to pull people out. You do see the fire dancer brought out there. You then see the two-- Yeah, Ornna. The Knot sisters are brought out and pushed out there and they're all looking very frustrated.
 MARISHA: Are people being amicable?
 MATT: Yeah, they're not shoving them around, they're just calling them out to the front so they know where they are.
 MARISHA: Okay. When I look around do I see any type of movement in the shadows, anyone looking suspicious?
 MATT: Make a perception check. 
 MARISHA: Ooh yeah! Natural 18. 21.
 MATT: 21. Okay, as you glance about, you don't see anything lurking in the shadows. What you do notice though, is one of them bring Toya out of one of the tents that's on the southern side and as he brings her out there's a heavy thud sound and you see coming out from behind the tent the large form of-- you heard the name Kylre once, but the "devil toad." The obese lizard man who's stomping up behind. 
 LAURA: Is he a dude or is he a creature?
 MATT: It looks like a lizard man, so scaled, humanoid, but extremely thick, bulbous belly, large, almost frog like legs--
 TRAVIS: Bipedal or on all fours?
 MATT: Due to the size of his form, mostly all fours and lumbering forward on all of them but sits back on a bipedal situation.
 MARISHA: So they're bringing the both of them out? 
 MATT: The toad is hiding behind the tent and as soon as Toya comes out, comes up to the guard and puffs up its chest. The guard spins around and goes for the blade and pulls it out just carefully.
 MARISHA: Am I still next to the horse?
 MATT: The horse is currently still up on the cart, but is about 30 feet from you.
 SAM: Beast Shape!
 MARISHA: I'm going to take my staff and give a really nice whack to the horse to get it to run. 
 MATT: You know what? Let's go ahead and make an animal handling check on that. 
 SAM: We never get to make those!
 LIAM: First of the show! 
 MARISHA: Oh my god, I'm so nervous right now.
 TRAVIS: You're good, you're good, you're good.
 MARISHA: That's not great. 11?
 MATT: 11 will do. It wasn't a hard DC but it was more knowing where to hit it to where it would cause it to bolt verses just get angry. 
 MARISHA: Get pissed, sure, kick me. 
 MATT: So going for, not to actually hurt the creature but just enough to spook it, you hit it in the right place towards the back of its hindquarters to cause it to suddenly rear up (neighs)(cart clattering noise) and go into a sprint. The cart begins to bounce and smash onto the ground. You can see the wheels clattering into the rocks and the stone between the bits of--
 MARISHA: Can I go in the opposite direction and try and loop around to the south side of the tent?
 MATT: Make a stealth check please. 
 MARISHA: Big dice, big dice. Okay, 19!
 MATT: Okay. You dart around the north side of these tents and you're pretty sure you weren't seen. As the cart begins to bolt off behind this horse, you see all the crownsguard turn. The one that was currently staring at the devil toad glances off to the side. As he glances off, the devil toad takes Toya and just pulls her to him protectively and the guard puts his sword away. "Check!" Points to them and then bolts off to go after the horse. The other three stay, watching over the group.
 MARISHA: Okay, can I loop around, kind of come up behind them? 
 MATT: I mean, they're scattered a bit but there's--
 MARISHA: The devil toad and Toya. 
 MATT: Oh yeah. Make another stealth check. You're running through open areas each time you're doing this.
 MARISHA: Yep. (yells) Did you see that?! It leaned to a four. Ten.
 TRAVIS: That is a bastard die right there.
 MARISHA: That sucked.
 TRAVIS: That's a tease. 
 MARISHA: Laura, put him in the dice jail. 
 LAURA: I don't have my dice jail out yet. It's okay, he'll chill there. 
 MATT: As you come up around the back of the devil toad, the guard that runs past doesn't immediately notice you because he's focused on where this cart is running off and you can see another guard that was far away from this encampment that's circling back with him. The two of them are now bolting in the direction as the cart begins to slow. It's not just going forward forever but it spooked him and it's starting to slow down. They're just going to inspect it. However, as you slink up behind the devil toad's head curls back towards you and you hear this deep, guttural (growls).
 MARISHA: "Okay. It's okay. Toya?" And I look at Toya. "Hey, come on, let's get out of here, let's go."
 MATT: At which point a voice says, "Excuse me?!”
 MATT: And you can see the three guards are there staring at you. 
 MARISHA: Fuck. You didn't say there were fucking guards.
 MATT: I did say there were three guards. The three guards watching them. 
 MARISHA: I thought you said they left. 
 MATT: One of them left.
 MARISHA: One of them left. So wait. Oh shit.
 MATT: It's a bad stealth check, I'm sorry. But there's now three crownsguard right there and they're like, "Can I help you?"
 TRAVIS: Time to go to jail.
 LAURA: Ooh, this is so exciting.
 SAM: Kill them all. 
 MARISHA: Ey! I was actually just looking for the loo? 
 MATT: The guard that's closest to you glances to the other guys and goes, "She was with the group, right?" They recognize you, and they look at each other. "You're going to the stockade, my dear."
 MARISHA: No!
 MATT: The three guards slowly approach and they begin to take out chains and manacle you up. 
 SAM: In an effort not to go to jail, you went *to* the jail.
 MARISHA: I'm trying to get the girl. I was trying to free the damn girl.
 MATT: I know.
 TALIESIN: You'll be fine.
 MATT: So you're shackled and begin to be dragged toward the stockade.
 MARISHA: It's just the two guards, right?
 MATT: It's the two guards now. As you're being brought back you can see more guards are coming from the city to the carnival. They're keeping it under surveillance.
 MARISHA: So are they taking me away?
 MATT: They're taking you to the city, yeah. 
 MARISHA: What are they doing with Toya? Anything? Are they leaving them behind?
 MATT: They're leaving them behind currently with the guards that are there. They're not arresting anybody from the carnival but they're not letting them leave. But they're keeping them there.
 MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to do a quick--
 SAM: Kill them all.
 MARISHA: I'm in shackles?
 MATT: You are.
 MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to do some monk shit here. I'm going to elbow one of the guards. Right in the ribs. And take the other one and bash the other one in the face and then I'm going to turn to Toya and I'm going to say "Run! Run! Go! Run!" 
 MATT: Okay. Go ahead and--
 SAM: Make all kinds of rolls.
 MATT: First, go ahead and make an athletics check. 
 MARISHA and SAM: This is a terrible idea. 
 LAURA: To not drag any attention towards her, you are completely shoving her into the limelight. 
 MARISHA: Trying to distract these fucking assholes. That is a six. Ten.
 MATT: As you go back to elbow, you get halfway there before your chains go taut. They're both holding the chain at each side, and you see the tension of it; you can’t even get him from behind. You imagine in your head; you go over it two or three times. As you go through the first step-- (grunt) doesn’t go anywhere.
 TRAVIS: Tried to do the Sherlock Holmes.
 MARISHA: Do I at least get the "Run!" out to Toya?
 MATT: No. I'm sorry.
 MARISHA: Is she just standing there? Waiting for a guard?
 TRAVIS: She sees you having a seizure in the chains.
 (laughter)
 MARISHA: What is she doing? Is she running?
 MATT: No. Honestly, the devil toad and her seem pretty close. He is grabbing her in a protective manner.
 MARISHA: No, they can both run. Run for your life! Fine, whatever. She wants to get arrested at this point.
 MATT: Two bad rolls in a row. I know. Level two. 
 MARISHA: I go join my friends.
 MATT: You will shortly. Ahead of her, along the way, Gustav is just quiet. Bo the Breaker, Bosun, as you know him by his full name, is grumbling under his breath and is trying to out loud piece together thoughts on what may have what transpired, saying things like, "I don’t know, you think it is done on the inside? Or is this someone trying sabotage it?"
 TALIESIN: I think maybe it has nothing to do with us. I think maybe we were just caught in the crossfire.
 MATT: It is quite possible.
 TALIESIN: Sorry sir. Trying to keep my mouth shut.
 MATT: One of the guards tugs on both of your chains and says, "Quiet now! Save it for the lawmaster." They bring you in. You go in through the Lochward into the Hillsward, which is the southern portion of Trostenwald. You are brought to the outside of the stockade, which is a large single story, tall, rectangular building of large stones and masonry. It is built for function. It is not a very beautiful building, but it is defensible and it seems fairly well made. However, there are the banners of the crowns guard marking the double door entrance. As you are brought within, you can already see there are two central chairs where two current watch sit just watching the front door. Beyond the right you see is an office that you guys are dragged to and the rest who eventually catch up to the group. You are all brought inside this darkened office. Inside, relatively simple. This isn’t a library type study office. This is very much for function. There is a couple of small crates that contain materials that are too far shattered to see the details of it. Look to be pieces of paper, probably gathered evidence or weapons that have been reclaimed. There is a stone desk on the far end, and there, within this office, already accompanied by a messenger dressed for immediate travel is a tough looking dwarven woman in her middle years rapidly scrawling on parchment. Her black hair is streaked with silver, tumbling past her red and gray leather armor. She finishes writing on this parchment, rolls it up, and hands it to the messenger who immediately darts out of the room, without a word, past you guys, giving you a brief look as he continues on whatever his business is. As soon as your eyes pass off the messenger you hear a loud slam and you glance back. She has put her hands on the table. She glances up, "All right, what riff raff have you brought in to me this day?" The watchmaster takes the chains of the three of you and pulls you to the front of the group and says, "Sorry to be a bother, but we have three individuals arrested in connection with, as you have heard so far, the deaths at the carnival performance this evening." She rolls her eyes. "All right, bring them forward." They go ahead and pull the chains up. The watchmaster bows his head and then leaves the room. She steps forward and goes, "I am Norda. It is my job to keep this city safe and keep shite like what happened tonight from happening. I approved your second time on the outskirts of our town and you have killed two of my people. What have you to say about yourselves?" 
 TALIESIN: Exactly how did we kill them, exactly?
 MATT: She glances over at you. Glances over at Gustav, "I have been told by my guard that you gave performance and as part of this performance you released two beasts into the midst of the population."
 LAURA: Well technically, he wasn’t part of the performance, technically he was saving everyone. Technically.
 TALIESIN: Thank you. Yes, you see--
 MATT: Gustav interrupts you and says, “I’m so sorry, my liege. Please, I take full responsibility for what happened this evening on myself. These people around me had nothing to do with this. They are not part of the carnival, they were just merely helping. It is my carnival, and whatever judgement there lies, I take upon myself and my head.” At which point Bo the half-orc steps forward, against his chains and goes, “Gustav, what are you doing?” He’s like, “Shut. Up. Please, whatever judgement there is, put it upon me,” and he bows his head low. “Is that the case? Is he the only one?” She takes a good, hard look at you and Bo the Breaker.
 TALIESIN: Oh, are you waiting for me to speak? Yes, he’s the only one.
 MATT: Make a persuasion check.
 TALIESIN: Natural 20. About fucking time, you little shit!
 MATT: She gives you a look. Looks over at Bo the Breaker. Shakes her head. “Keep these two downstairs. This one let go. He seems to be free. We’ll be talking to you very soon.” At which point, the crownsguard drag the chains back and Gustav gives you a quick look under his eye and goes-- as they’re pulled out of the room, out of sight. She glances to you, “Well, you’re out of chains! That’s great. Doesn’t mean you’re absolved of the investigation. So, where are you staying? You and your compatriots?”
 LAURA: Well, technically we just all met, technically.
 MATT: “Well, technically, as far as I’m concerned, you’re all together as part of this investigation.”
 LAURA: We’re a group you guys!
 (laughter)
 MATT: “So we’re going to have our investigators come to wherever you’re staying, which--,” and she looks down at some papers here, “-- looks to be the Nestled Nook?”
 TRAVIS: That’s correct.
 MATT: “All right. Don’t leave the city. We’ll be in touch.”
 LAURA: Great, I really like it here so that’s good that we get to stay so long.
 MATT: “Do you have something to say?”
 TALIESIN: No. Just shocked to see someone die in front of me not more than--
 TRAVIS: I can assure you, we’re here to cause no trouble. We will be as compliant as we possibly can be.
 MATT: “Good. Dismissed!” She claps the edge of the table. The remaining crownsguard, who’s left there to keep watch, escorts you out off the stockade, escorts you onto the street.
 LAURA: Her accent is really strong! It’s hard to not match her accent!
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: It’s the one accent that I really have trouble with.
 TRAVIS: Would you call it infectious?
 TALIESIN: Bastard.
 MATT: Sorry.
 TALIESIN: The one that we know is a problem. 
 LIAM: I’m going to call my cat back to me and I drop the telepathy and I just start tugging you back to the Nestled Nook. Come on, we have to talk about this. We have to decide what we’re going to do.
 SAM: Right away.
 TRAVIS: Excuse me--
 LAURA: They’re not with us.
 TRAVIS: Oh, I thought you were right behind us.
 LIAM: My cat was in there, but not I.
 MATT: Yeah, but you’d have to stay within 100 feet to maintain that.
 LIAM: Well, we would’ve walked up to the building, the cat would’ve scurried around, if possible. So I’d like to think that I heard all that, which is why just I said all the things I did.
 MATT: You did hear all that. Okay, and I’d say, as they’re making their way out, you can probably duck around without them seeing you as they left. Yeah, you can do that. So, you guys are jettisoned into the street. It’s now probably just past midnight.
 TRAVIS: Mollymauk, I don’t mean to pry into your business, but has this ever happened to you before?
 TALIESIN: This has never-- anything like this has ever happened before. And thank you. For the record, I don’t owe any of you anything--
 TRAVIS: Oh, I don’t know about that.
 TALIESIN: --I swear, but thank you, and I’m ready to help with this.
 LAURA: Do you think it was the little girl?
 TALIESIN: No! That’s an act, that’s not anything. It’s just a show!
 TRAVIS: Right, the large toad that was with the girl, what’s the story there?
 TALIESIN: It’s nothing special, it’s just a guy making a buck, all right? He’s fine!
 MATT: You hear the footfalls of guards approach and the rattle of chains as you see Beauregard--
 TALIESIN: By the way, where's the obnoxious one? The really loud--
 MATT: As opposed the rest of you who are gingerly brought up, you see Beauregard being pulled forward but now the chains around her are being pulled taught on two sides. She’s being brought forward like a wild animal almost.
 MATT: And she's just being led towards the stockade.
 MARISHA: Help.
 LAURA: What happened?
 MARISHA: Help. Help help help. Help help. Help help help.
 (laughter)
 MARISHA: Help. I'm with you, I'm with you. Help help.
 LAURA: Oh, I thought you didn't like jails.
 MARISHA: (clears throat) Help.
 TALIESIN: Is this part of the show by the way? I was just curious.
 TRAVIS: Unfortunately, no.
 MATT: Which is the last thing you see as she is yanked into the stockade and out of sight.
 TALIESIN: I'm going to be very helpful and not go in there with the two of you while you try and get her out.
 LAURA: So should we go in and try to get her out?
 TRAVIS: Well, yeah!
 LAURA: Okay.
 TALIESIN: I'll stand guard.
 LAURA: We’ll follow her in.
 TRAVIS: Don't. Leave.
 TALIESIN: I have nowhere to go.
 MATT: You walk in behind her. You watch her being pulled to the stairs. She's bypassing the office of the Lawmaster right now and is being brought to incarceration before being questioned. They bring her to the stairs and a torch-lit, subterranean basement area. As you begin to approach and follow behind, you can see one of the guards who is currently on watch. He sees you guys just exit and then walk back in, following another prisoner. And stands up and goes, "I'm sorry, where are you going?"
 TRAVIS: It was a busy day for us. Unfortunately, we're partially responsible for this one as well. Bad luck.
 LAURA: She was also helping to save a lot of people. Big misunderstanding.
 MATT: "Welp, see her into her cell and please exit the vicinity."
 TRAVIS: Fair enough.
 MATT: "Appreciate that." He follows behind you guys. They're on high alert and they're a bit scattered. You get the sense right now that they have a lot of their initial stock of guards off-site right now. So they're doing the best they can to hold on to what they currently have in the stockade.
 TRAVIS: To the side I say to Jester, I say: This does not really fall in with keeping a low profile. We talked about this.
 LAURA: I know isn't it so weird?
 TRAVIS: Yeah, it is.
 MATT: You guys follow down to the basement portion of this. Which there's a heavily locked door immediately that is opened from the opposite side. You hear a couple of keys turn and the shifting of wood against metal before the door opens and reveals the rest of a long hallway that is flanked by two rows of cells. Iron bars about maybe two inches apart going across the entirety of this long hallway. You can't quite see the end of it until you step down to where the door frame is. And there is probably a total of ten cells to each side. As you walk through, you can see in the off shadows in the corners a few huddled bodies hunched or asleep. Keeping to the shadows and out of the light. The smell of mildewed wet compost and piss hits your nose like a wall.
 LAURA: It smells like Caleb down here.
 (laughter)
 MATT: You get about five cells in where you can see the guard that was previously in there just finish off closing the cell that contains both Gustav and Bo the Breaker. They move to the cell just beyond that, open that cell, and then go ahead and put Beauregard into that one.
 TRAVIS: Are they not going to take her to see the Lawmaker?
 LAURA: I know, why doesn't she get to talk to the Lawmaster?
 MATT: As he closes and locks it, "Because she decided not to come helpfully."
 LAURA: What do you mean?
 MARISHA: Ah, oh, no you misunderstood. See that was just, I have this spasm that has this twitch. It was an injury from, like, a childhood thing.
 LAURA: Oh no, are you guys making fun of her because of her spasm?
 MARISHA: Yeah that's actually-- (fake crying) it was very sensitive for me. I had a really tough childhood. I was just trying to find a bathroom.
 MATT: The three guards walk away, not caring. Who were there previously and--
 SAM: Spasm shaming.
 MATT: At this point, a man who is on the far end of the hall walks up. And you can see him, he's a man with a heavy, bushy beard that obscures a lot of a dark leather mantle, over a general cloth tunic. He has burly arms, heavy torso, super scrawny legs, a widow's peak, and he looks to be the jailer. He walks up and puts his hand on the bars and goes, "Oh well, if you want to be patient, I'm sure the Lawmaster will be here sometime in the morning and you can discuss whatever this business is. But if you want to say goodbye, now's the time."
 TRAVIS: Actually, we were just upstairs and it would really help us if we could, perhaps, expedite the process. Perhaps there's an arrangement we could come to if she could see the Lawmaster now.
 MARISHA: Yeah, I'm looking injured, man. I show him my eight hit points of damage.
 TALIESIN: How many kittens is that again?
 MATT: That's sixteen kittens. Kittens have half of a hit point, I don't think kittens have more than that.
 LIAM: That's eight Frumpkins.
 TRAVIS: An audience is all we're asking for. No favors.
 MARISHA: Yeah, this is just a wrong time, wrong place thing.
 MATT: Make a persuasion check.
 SAM: Use it.
 TRAVIS: God bless. 16.
 MATT: He gives you a look and says, "All right, but if she gets angry, it's not on me."
 TRAVIS: I understand. Thank you for your understanding.
 LAURA: She's a very calm person. I've never seen her angry, ever.
 MATT: He gives a whistle. Another crownsguard comes up and approaches him and he goes, "I'm sorry. Could you go and fetch the Lawmaster? They are requesting an audience. If she gets angry, just add it to this one's sentence." The guard exits and a brief time by, you can hear the slight muddled cursing of a dwarven female descending the stairs. You can see she has an overcoat on, was halfway out of the stockades finishing up her evening in her office.
 TRAVIS: Beau, remember your little sister.
 SAM: Oh, what? Little sister? What?
 LIAM: We're not there.
 MATT: So, as the Lawmaster approaches, now pulling the coat over herself, she goes, "Okay, so you've returned, apparently, needing to poke into what business now before I go off and get some food?"
 TRAVIS: I do hate to trouble you again, twice in the same evening. It's incredibly inconvenient.
 MATT: "I hate being troubled twice in the same evening."
 TRAVIS: If we may, this sweet girl here was also part of our party and she is quite the protective one. I'm afraid that she was also providing aid to our fellows in that tent. I'm afraid her younger sister was attacked in a similar way. I feel it's only prudent to acknowledge that she was trying to protect this young dwarven girl that performed in the circus. She means no harm.
 LAURA: It was an adopted sister.
 MARISHA: I practically raised her. It's a sensitive subject.
 MATT: Okay. I would like a deception check.
 TRAVIS: Oh, yeah baby. 24. Natural 18.
 MATT: Modified by their answers.
 LAURA: I was helping!
 TRAVIS: I'm new at this stat! Don't fuck it up!
 MATT: She gives a narrow look through her eyes, looks to one of the other guards that you can see standing in the back, a familiar one to you, Beau, and goes, "Is this true?" He goes, It appeared to us that she was attempting to escape upon us trying to bring calm to a very tense situation, but I'll leave it in your realm, Lawmaster." She looks back. "So your sister, apparently, is part of this scenario as well?"
 MARISHA: Adopted sister.
 MATT: "Okay. Well, your sister's under investigation."
 MARISHA: Sure.
 LAURA: She's staying at the same place that we are.
 TRAVIS: Indeed. And we can be found at any hour. The Nestled Nook Inn is where we are.
 MARISHA: And I'm more than willing to be compliant with the investigation. In fact, you can see the injury the beast left on my ribs, so if you want to test it for any type of specimen samples, feel free. It's very painful, but I'm willing to do it for the cause.
 LAURA: Do you need me to heal that?
 MARISHA (through gritted teeth): No! For the cause! Do it for the cause!
 MATT: At which she looks to you now and goes, "Are you saying you might have been infected by this beast?"
 MARISHA: No. It's a separate issue. There was two things going on. There was, like, the big angry toad beast and he got a swipe at me. And then there were people who were getting attacked. 
 MATT: "Theeds!" And she looks over to the jailer, who goes, "Aye?" And she goes, "Could you have a look at this wound for me real fast? I want to make sure this isn't something that's going to spread."
 MARISHA: Yeah! Yeah. Uh-huh.
 TRAVIS: A great idea indeed. And thankfully there was no flesh-to-flesh contact.
 MARISHA: Nope.
 LAURA: Yeah. The big zombie beast especially was using a lot of, like, sticks and stuff to attack people more than any kind of mouth.
 (laughter)
 MATT: The jailer, Theeds, takes a quick look at the wound and he goes, "No, it appears to mainly be just bludgeoning. I mean, we'll keep a close eye on her." You can see now the Lawmaster is rubbing her eyes in frustration and goes, "I just want to sleep."
 TRAVIS: Indeed. It would give us no greater pleasure than to get out of your hair.
 MATT: "Fine. We'll have guards posted at the outside of the inn. You're not to leave until this investigation is complete. It may take days. Until we find out who's responsible for these deaths and bring them to justice, you are not to leave the tavern."
 TRAVIS: Understood.
 LAURA: Like, at all during the day, even? Just a question. If we wanted to shop or something. Not okay?
 MATT: "Not until this is done."
 LAURA: Cool.
 MATT: "Because otherwise, you're welcome to stay here, instead."
 LAURA: It is really beautiful here, but I think I'd rather stay at the inn?
 TRAVIS: Indeed we would. This is most gracious of you, Lawmaster Norda.
 MATT: "Get them the fuck out." She turns around and sighs heavily as she stomps out of the chamber. The jailer opens the cell door and allows Beauregard back out, and he looks a bit confused but amused at the same time. The guards that had originally arrested you escort you out, not leaving any element of their sight off of you. They escort you guys to the actual inn itself, to the bottom floor of the Nestled Nook Inn, watch you enter, and then post up right outside the main entrance to the tavern.
 LAURA: You should have spasmed a couple times on the way here.
 MARISHA: Aw, shit.
 LAURA: Yeah. Opportunity missed.
 MARISHA: My little sister? What the what?
 LAURA: She's a dwarf! She's human!
 TRAVIS: What? No, I was trying to say she had a little sister that had a similar incident and that made you try to protect Toya. I was trying to throw you a bone.
 LAURA: Oh. You didn't make that clear at all.
 MATT: Are you guys up in your room, or are you in the tavern?
 LIAM: Yeah. We're having a talk.
 TRAVIS: We're under watch.
 MARISHA: I was just trying to go with what you said.
 TRAVIS: Yeah. You did all right.
 MARISHA: All right. I mean, it kind of worked. But you're not entirely wrong! I was trying to go get the stupid little girl, who seemed to be stupid.
 TRAVIS: Did you see anything?
 MARISHA: I tried to save her. I was like, get the hint, what's going on?
 LAURA: Why would you save her? She turned those people into zombies.
 MARISHA: (stammers)
 TRAVIS: We don't know that.
 LAURA: I mean, she could have.
 TALIESIN: She didn't.
 LAURA: Oh, hi! You're here.
 MARISHA: Yeah, if anything, we should be looking at this guy. Why are we putting our neck out for you?
 TALIESIN: You're putting your neck out for Toya for some strange reason and I don't know why, she's perfectly capable of handling herself.
 TRAVIS: Have you been to this town before?
 TALIESIN: Not that I can remember. They all look the same after a while.
 MATT: You've come through once, but that was a while back and you weren't really paying attention.
 TALIESIN: Busy, yeah.
 TRAVIS: And you've never seen conditions like this affect any other carnival goer before?
 TALIESIN: Nothing like this. Hundreds, possibly thousands of shows. Yeah, thousands of shows. Nothing. Never. It's not us.
 LAURA: So great! We're stuck in a city that has zombie issues, that's all.
 TRAVIS: Where are the other two?
 TALIESIN: Which other two?
 TRAVIS: The stinky one and the little one.
 TALIESIN: Oh, your friends!
 TRAVIS: Yeah. Can we look around and see if we spot Caleb and--
 TALIESIN: You call them Stinky and the little one? All right.
 MATT: You spot around the interior of the tavern. They don't appear to be nearby.
 TRAVIS: I wonder if they came back.
 LAURA: I'll go up and ask the tavern keeper.
 MATT: Okay. Yorda?
 LAURA: Yeah, Yorda.
 MATT: "Oh, hi! Everything all right? You had a few bruiser types leading you in here, some of the crownsguard, huh?"
 LAURA: Oh my gosh, there was this big trouble at the carnival, did you go?
 MATT: "I heard about that. I didn't go in there, but people are coming in here saying--"
 LAURA: Somebody turned into a zombie and then--
 MATT: "I heard that! That's incredible!"
 LAURA: Yeah! And then we're all under investigation because we saved them! These guards are weird. Hey, did you see the wizard guy, the stinky guy and the little halfling?
 MATT: "Yeah, they came in not but a few minutes before you did. They went upstairs."
 LAURA: Oh, great! They're here!
 TRAVIS: They are?
 LAURA: Yeah.
 TRAVIS: Good.
 MATT: Meanwhile, the two of you are upstairs in your own chambers.
 LIAM: During all of that, I would have dragged you back here, brought you upstairs. And I whip off my ratty coat, throw it on the bed and sit down on the ground so that I'm eye level with you, Nott.
 SAM: Hi.
 LIAM: Nott, you and I have to make some decisions right now, okay?
 SAM: Now?
 LIAM: Yes.
 SAM: Why?
 LIAM: Well, I know why we said we were coming here.
 SAM: Get some booze, got some books, find a little taste of civilization, maybe some better food.
 LIAM: Yeah. I didn't say, I also had the idea-- you know, you and I meeting and teaming up has been a good thing.
 SAM: Oh, yes, very good. I know everyone else makes fun of your smell, but I don't smell nothing.
 LIAM: That's what I like about you. I have been thinking, and yesterday just furthers that thinking, that I don't think you and I are enough. I had the idea that we would come here maybe and find others that we could tag along with, or meet up the way you and I did. But now I think that is a terrible idea! The people we spent the day with are lunatics. I don't think that we can do this. I've changed my mind entirely, and I think we should go, but we can't now because we are stuck here for the moment.
 SAM: Under sort of holding arrest or something? We can't leave the city.
 LIAM: No.
 SAM: But I was thinking about this. The people we met down there and spent the day with: they are lunatics, but they draw a lot of attention to themselves, leaving us free to sort of slink back into the shadows a little bit. It might be sort of the perfect camouflage. No one's going to be looking for a little goblin girl anymore, because they'll be looking at the crazy people, the tieflings running around smashing shit.
 LIAM: You know, I had not thought of it quite in that way and that is a good point, but I am not convinced. I'm not convinced. And perhaps we're better off-- maybe I was too ambitious.
 SAM: Well, let's give it a day and if things seem a little bit, you know, skinky-doodie tomorrow, we can fritter away in the middle of the day or something.
 LIAM: All right. Well, we'll wait and see. While we're here, one thing, okay? No Money Pot. No Rat Food. None of those plays. I have silver, we don't need it right now.
 SAM: But we need to replenish the healing potion you used. If we don't have that, then what happens the next you get, in trouble?
 LIAM: We're sealed here, and they are watching. We're with a couple of tieflings, a little person in a doll mask, and a dirty ginger. We've got people staring at us every second of the day. We need to dial it back a little bit.
 SAM: All right, but how on earth are we-- all right. We can cool it with the cons for a couple of days. But I can't promise that I won't get the itch again.
 LIAM: You just talk to me. You hold Frumpkin. Just keep your hands full with Frumpkin, okay? Hold my cat, okay?
 SAM: All right.
 LIAM: And then this is going to blow over because we didn't do anything! We did something good.
 SAM: No! I didn't do nothing, we just went to a show.
 LIAM: That's right.
 SAM: It was a pretty good show. Up until, you know, the dead people part.
 LIAM: But it was a good show, wasn't it?
 SAM: Yeah! Well, we'll lay low. Should we pretend that we're still friends with these people?
 LIAM: I was going to suggest the same thing. In fact, I think we should go downstairs. They're going to be coming back. We don't want to cause a stir with them, either. We just want to leave if that's what we're going to do.
 SAM: Don't worry! I'll turn on the charm.
 TALIESIN: Thank God.
 LIAM: Okay. Let's get a drink.
 SAM: Thank gods.
 LIAM: We head downstairs.
 MATT: You guys head down. You get to the bottom of the stairs just in time to see Jester, Beauregard, Molly, and Fjord looking across the tavern, making their way in your direction, and you guys notice them meeting you in the tavern room, as well.
 SAM: Oh, thank God you're here and safe! We missed you! Somehow we got separated! Friends.
 LAURA: That happens, yes.
 MARISHA: Can I insight check him?
 MATT: Sure. 
 SAM and MATT: Her.
 MARISHA: Her. Sam. Natural 20.
 SAM: I'm lying!
 (laughter)
 MARISHA: Front butt?! You just saw that, too?!
 (laughter)
 MARISHA: You guys peaced out pretty quickly.
 LIAM: We did, I did not come to Trostenwald to go to jail.
 TRAVIS: What did you come to Trostenwald for?
 LIAM: We are tired. We've been traveling a long time. We've been saving. Wanted to take it easy for a few days. 
 TRAVIS: Sure, I'm not trying to pry. I was just curious where you were going. 
 MARISH: Just curious why you have a mask.
 TALIESIN: If I'm going to listening to somebody's life story I'm going to need a drink. You, gorgeous, what's your name? 
 MATT: You look over and see a woman with darker hair, the general barmaid. "Adelaine."
 TALIESIN: Adelaine, I would like a round for all these terrible people and one for myself. What's the difference between these three beers? I've honestly got to admit, they all taste the same to me. 
 MATT: "Go with the von Brandt."
 TALIESIN: Let's get a round of von Brandt for everybody. 
 TARVIS: Actually, if it's all the same I'm not really an ale fan. Do you have any fire whiskey?
 MATT: "We can get you some liquor, aye."
 LAURA: Can I have some milk?
 SAM: Two, please.
 MATT: "All right." She walks away.
 LAURA: You think she heard that I wanted milk?
 TALIESIN: I don't know. I'm going to ask for one of each of these beers because I want to have a tasting competition. I'm not going to be drinking alone. 
 LIAM: I wander away from these two with their questions and I sit down with Molly. 
 LAURA: Caleb, you want to see something cool? 
 LIAM: I would love to see something cool. 
 LAURA: I show Caleb where I etched the dick in the table a couple nights ago. 
 MARISHA: Yeah! Bring it back.
 LIAM: That's pretty good.
 TALIESIN: How'd you etch a deck in the table? 
 LAURA: It's a dick.
 TALIESIN: Oh.
 LIAM: Have you always been an artist? 
 LAURA: I have actually, I've been an artist since I was little. 
 TALIESIN: I think that's what they look like.
 LAURA: I've seen a lot of dicks. That is what most of them look like. 
 TALIESIN: I'm already in my cups.
 LAURA: What? 
 LIAM: So where do you two come from?
 LAURA: Us two? 
 LIAM: Yes, you two with the horns. 
 LAURA: Well, I don't know where he comes from. You think we all come from the same place? That was really inconsiderate.
 LIAM: No, you are very different it's very clear
 LAURA: He's purple
 TALIESIN: She's blue.
 LAURA: Which is pretty rare.
 LIAM: He's every color.
 TALIESIN: It's very true.
 LAURA: I'm from Nicodranas.
 LIAM: Remember when we started the first campaign and all those places came in a split second and all that history. I'm from Shrev`nam Chicago. Oh yes.
 TALIESIN: I'm from the circus.
 LIAM: So you're a traveler then? 
 TALIESIN: Oh yeah. Quite a while. 
 LIAM: Since childhood? 
 TALIESIN: Long as I can reasonably remember at the very least. It's been a while. It's nice. I like it. They’re good people. Work hard. 
 LIAM: You have a lot of scars. 
 TALIESIN: That's a very funny story, actually.
 TRAVIS: I like funny stories. 
 TALIESIN: Me too. 
 TRAVIS: You did some crazy shit with that sword of yours. 
 TALIESIN: Thank you. These swords-- you buy a drink and we'll see. 
 TRAVIS: You polish off that one already? 
 LAURA: Wow, that's a lot-- okay.
 TRAVIS: Can we get another round? For the--
 TALIESIN: How much I owe you for the first round?
 MATT: They are keeping a tally of the table.
 LIAM: Frumpkin scrabbles up onto Nott's shoulder.
 SAM: Hi Frumpy, nice to see you again. 
 TALIESIN: Mother always told me to never give a story away for free.
 TRAVIS: Wise words.
 LAURA: My mother said don't give away other things for free. 
 TALIESIN: I already like your mother.
 MARISHA: My mother always said nothing in life is free. 
 TALIESIN: I can tell.
 MARISHA: None of this absolves the dodgy goblin who slinked past that first question. Where are you from? What are you traveling from? Why the mask? 
 TRAVIS: Only because we seem to find ourselves in quite the predicament. 
 SAM: We're just a couple of friends, strolling around the countryside looking for adventure.
 MARISHA: Sure you are.
 LIAM: Do you see many goblins walking around cities here?
 MARISHA: It has nothing to do with that. People who move from place to place frequently tend to have other stories as to why they're doing it.
 LIAM: Well, let me make it clear: goblins are not typically welcome in any cities, that is why the mask.
 MARISHA: Well, you're going back to the goblin thing. I'm more curious about the travel thing.
 SAM: We have a string of bad luck. We tend to get in trouble in places for various reasons. Some of which is my fault. Most of which is my fault. I have sticky fingers. I can't help myself sometimes. I'm fascinated by little bobbles and fancy pieces of jewelries and *I love trinkets so much!* I just have to take them, and have them with me, and put them in my pockets. It's gotten us in a few scrapes a couple times. Caleb, he is fantastic. Very patient with me, understands. But really it's my fault; it's not him. He's a smart man, a brilliant magician! Have you seen? Some of his tricks are phenomenal, really.
 TRAVIS: No, I'd love to.
 SAM: I feel bad to because we never stay in one place for him to have a decent shower.
 (laughter)
 TRAVIS: It's a moving story.
 MARISHA: I immediately check my pockets after that to see is Nott has lifted anything. Is everything still there, all my coin?
 MATT: Make an investigation check.
 TALIESIN: I'm going to join you on this one.
 MARISHA: Not great. Not great at all. Six.
 TALIESIN: 16.
 MATT: 16? Everything seems to be in order for you.
 MARISHA: Wait that was a 15! Right? That was the dice I rolled? 16.
 MATT: Everything seems to be in order.
 MARISHA: Okay.
 SAM: Anyway, that's the long and short of it.
 LAURA: What do you do with the things once you steal them?
 SAM: Well the nice ones I keep. I have a little--
 LAURA: Do you have a collection?
 SAM: I collect a lot of things, but in the last place we hunkered down, it was all taken from me. We were in one of those prisons before-- Am I sharing too much? I'm sharing too much, aren't I? We were in a prison, they took all of our belongings. I lost all of my collections. I has a lovely rock collection. I had a rare coin collection. I had a stick collection. Yeah, it's all gone now.
 LAURA: What about shiny things, though?
 SAM: I love them. I just don't have any right now.
 LAURA: Because I think if you have sticky fingers for sticks and rocks, I don't think that will get you in trouble.
 SAM: True. But they were like people's canes and things.
 (laughter)
 SAM: I mean I call them sticks because I don't need them. But I suppose they really needed them.
 LAURA: Yeah, that makes sense.
 TALIESIN: There's only one way to find out.
 MARISHA: Wait, I'm sorry. I think I need clarification. If sticks mean things like valuable canes, what do rocks mean to you?
 SAM: You know those rocks that humans wear on their fingers and around their necks and stuff. They're really nice rocks.
 LIAM: We don't have many of those at the moment.
 TRAVIS: Would it be fair to say that the more someone desires something, the more you're interest increases?
 SAM: Oh I don't care about the people who have them. I just like pretty things. Toys, anything really.
 LAURA: I'll keep an eye out for things that you would like.
 SAM: Okay! Can you help with that?
 LAURA: I can if you want me to. Or I can point it out.
 MARISHA: Is it the joy of taking the things or do you just like gifts?
 SAM: No, it's the collecting.
 LIAM: It's like a nervous tick a little bit.
 TRAVIS: Are you good at it? Do you get caught very often?
 
SAM: Well, would you like a demonstration?
 LAURA: Yes!
 TRAVIS: Now, Jester, if I may, we are already in a little bit of a pickle.
 LAURA: Steal something from me! Do you want me to close my eyes?
 SAM: Sure! That’ll make it really easy. Are they closed?
 LAURA: Yeah.
 SAM: All right. Out of practice here. I'm going to do a shot. Crack my knuckles.
 LAURA: Just don't take the thing on my waist, because he'll be pissed.
 SAM: He'll be pissed? What?
 LAURA: Yeah.
 SAM: He?
 LAURA: Yeah.
 SAM: What's on your waist?
 TALIESIN: I'm looking at her waist. What's on her waist?
 MATT: What's on your waist?
 LAURA: My symbol to the Traveler.
 SAM: Oh. All right, I'll go to her left buttcheek pocket and fish around.
 LAURA: I'm in a dress. I don't have a pocket on my buttcheek. But you can try.
 SAM: What pockets do you have?
 LAURA: I would have pockets on the front of my dress, and maybe a little pouch on my hip.
 SAM: I'll do the hip pocket.
 MATT: All right, make a sleight of hand check.
 SAM: Three.
 (laughter)
 MATT: You close your eyes and feel a tug and a shake--
 SAM: Plus eight.
 MATT: What's your passive perception?
 TALIESIN: I'm going to guess ten.
 LAURA: No, it's 13.
 MATT: So, yeah, you totally feel--
 LAURA: You're doing great!
 SAM: This is not how it usually works! The person is not really expecting it. This is embarrassing, really. I have the one skill and I failed at it.
 LAURA: It's okay, you can keep practicing.
 LIAM: There is that one magic trick that you're able to do. Would you like to show them the magic trick that you can do? I pull out a small red clay ceramic bowl. Then I pull out a copper piece. Here, you know the trick, right?
 SAM: Yes, I know the trick. Takes a little bit of time, doesn't it?
 LIAM: You're good.
 SAM: Okay. (clears throat) I do know one piece of magic. Feast your eyes on the sacred money pot of school. If you place a copper piece into this pot and say the magic words-- what’s the magic word, again?
 LIAM: Fibulous.
 SAM: Fibulous! It will turn into a silver piece.
 LAURA: Should I say it?
 TALIESIN: I want to hear you say it, anyway.
 SAM: Only I can say it.
 (laughter)
 SAM: For everyone has their own magic word, and it won't work with you. By the ancient order of the school, fibulous!
 LIAM: That is a silver coin right there.
 LAURA: Oh my gosh. Wait a minute. Does this mean the silver I won from you was actually copper?
 SAM: No, it only works up.
 LAURA: Great! Thanks for the silver.
 SAM: Well, no, we weren't giving you the silver piece just showing you a bit of magic. This pot is actually quite powerful. It can do that once a day, so if you'd like to purchase it.
 LAURA: Can you turn this into a gold piece?
 SAM: Well, it only works once a day.
 LAURA: Well, tomorrow can you make it gold?
 SAM: I think it only does the copper to silver?
 LIAM: The magic is not that strong.
 SAM: Yes, it's a mild magic pot. But if you'd like to purchase it from us, we can sell it to you for five gold.
 LAURA: Five gold for one silver a day? That doesn't add up.
 TRAVIS: By the end of the week you made your money back.
 LAURA: No.
 SAM: At discount for friends, three gold.
 LAURA: Three gold.
 SAM: And for that, we'll teach you your own magic word.
 LAURA: That's pretty good.
 TALIESIN: That's 40 days.
 LAURA: 40 days?
 SAM: You can do it once a day forever, you have it for the rest of your life.
 LAURA: Yeah, but I have lots of money. I don't need it.
 SAM: But this is free money, that you don't have to work for.
 LIAM: Also, you know, they basically helped us out today. You can do it for one, for them.
 SAM: All right, one gold.
 LAURA: One gold. That's a really good deal. Did you hear how much he gave me a deal? Okay!
 MATT: Do you give him the gold?
 LAURA: Yes, I'll give him the gold. Hold on, let me make sure I have it. Where's my--?
 TALIESIN: It's the second button.
 LAURA: Oh, currency! Gold. Okay, one down.
 MARISHA: Do I notice anything shifty about that, while we were looking at his hands?
 MATT: Perception check.
 LAURA: What's my magic word?
 LIAM: It can be whatever you want it to be. You have to agree upon it and you have to focus on that word for one full day while you are in possession of the pot.
 MATT: You watch that copper piece become silver, magically.
 LAURA: How about skinky doodie?
 LIAM: Skinky doodie, that is unique. I'm sure no one else possession of that arcane power word. I could consider it yours if you focused on it all day tomorrow. But you really have to focus.
 LAURA: Okay, I will. Super a lot of focus. Skinky doodie. Thank you for this.
 SAM: It's a pleasure doing business with you. Does that answer your question? I've got some for you.
 MARISHA: You have questions for me?
 SAM: Yeah! How does someone like you -- you're human right?
 MARISHA: Yeah, I am.
 SAM: How do you come by learning Halfling?
 MARISHA: My parents were in the winery business. The wine making business. And halflings really like wine.
 SAM: Everyone likes wine!
 MARISHA: That's true.
 TRAVIS: Some people more than others.
 MARISHA: Some halflings just deal in wine a lot, and a lot did in the town that I'm from and then my parents wanted me to keep up with the books and all that stuff so it forced me to learn halfling. I was around it a lot.
 SAM: What town was that then?
 LAURA: It's close by here, right?
 MARISHA: It's a bit aways. It’s Kamordah.
 SAM: Hmm, haven't heard of it.
 MARISHA: It's a small farming town, it's no big deal. It's whatever.
 SAM: Nothing shady there!
 MARISHA: Nope, just a wandering traveler just like the rest of y'all.
 TRAVIS: Well I mean I was really impressed with the little trick, I sure would like to see a big trick.
 LAURA: I use Thaumaturgy to open all the windows!
 MATT: Being about one o'clock in the morning at this time, and the energy in the tavern has come to a quiet crawl, those who are keeping their cups are either snoring or in the process of preparing to go to sleep, you watch as the Adelaine, the barmaid is walking around cleaning up tables and suddenly all the windows in the room slam open with a heavy impact and there's a burst of wind that comes through. The two crownsguard that were outside flanking the opening doorway suddenly rush and look in and look about at the lot of you.
 TALIESIN: Sorry! Drinking! I did order two extra. Two extra?
 MATT: They both just slowly curl back to their perimeter.
 TALIESIN: You're no fun.
 MARISHA: Yeah, circus! Woo, circus coming to town!
 TRAVIS: Jester, I meant a trick from Caleb.
 LAURA: Oh.
 LIAM: You want to see a trick?
 TRAVIS: I would love one.
 LIAM: I am well into my second trost at this point. I can show you a trick. Young lady, if you would assist me please. Step up onto the table.
 SAM: Absolutely!
 MARISHA: Just don't break anything.
 LIAM: Adjust your minds. I begin to weave one hand in a slow circle around the other, and a globe of golden light poofs out.
 SAM: I put my hands and feet out in an akimbo pose.
 LIAM: A second little globule of light comes out.
 SAM: I feel it coming! Hit me!
 LIAM: Then two more at the same time come out of my hand. Then they amass upon my little companion and form a similar sized little humanoid of light that then coincides with my little friend. She is glowing golden on a table in the middle of the Nestled Nook.
 SAM: (sings)
 LIAM: The Goblight, ladies and gentlemen. The Goblight!
 SAM: Thank you!
 MATT: There's some claps in the back rooms. You see one of the drunken gentlemen has come to semi-consciousness and goes, “That's impressive!” then passes back out on the table.
 TRAVIS: How did you learn to do that?
 LIAM: I could always do that a little bit, as a kid. I was always good with magic. I had a knack for it. That one's easy. 
 TRAVIS: That's impressive. 
 LIAM: Well, thank you.
 MARISHA: Aw buddy.
 LAURA: Maybe he can teach you how to do that. 
 TRAVIS: Is it something that can be taught to others?
 TALIESIN: Are you trying to learn magic? Is that a thing?
 TRAVIS: Well, I'm just a little curious about it. How people use their magic.
 MARISHA: I've seen you have a few tricks up your sleeve. You seem like you're not totally magic inept. 
 TRAVIS: No, it's relatively new for me though, so I'm just trying to learn.
 LIAM: Are you reading a lot?
 TRAVIS: No, I wonder if maybe I should be?
 LIAM: Well, it could be helpful. Although, I'm a bit of an amateur teacher. I taught Nott the one trick you saw, but other things. We've been working together, I suppose I could try to help you.
 MARISHA: Have you had your abilities your whole life, like a kid?
 TRAVIS: No. Again, fairly recently.
 MARISHA: Something happen? 
 TRAVIS: Yeah. 
 LIAM: Oh, I'm sorry, do you two not know each other super well? You seem like you do.
 MARISHA: We got a good 24-48 hours on the rest of you.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, we're not super deep. 
 MARISHA: Nope. 
 SAM: Where did you come from then?
 TRAVIS: Well I came up from the town of Port Damali.
 LAURA: That's where we met!
 TRAVIS: Yeah, I met Jester a while back and after Ieft town, coming up to the northeast, I ran across her. I'd seen her do some of her magic before. That's what I'm trying to learn about. 
 LAURA: If you need anymore displays, you just let me know.
 LIAM: We've seen that window thing a couple times. It's good.
 MARISHA: Can I request a display? I think I have a broken rib. It might be getting more purple.
 LAURA: Oh yeah, I mean I can ask, but I think I'm tapped.
 MARISHA: I'll sleep it off, it's fine.
 LAURA: Yeah. I can try! I'll put my hand out. I'll try to cast Cure Wounds. I got shit. I got nothing. It's not happening.
 SAM: It's past midnight!
 LAURA: Oh, no. I've got to sleep.
 MATT: You concentrate for a moment. Make a medicine check.
 LAURA: Okay!
 SAM: Natural 12!
 LAURA: That's 17.
 MATT: 17. You focus on the bruised area, exposed out of her monk robes. You watch as the slight bruising turns like a sickly green.
 SAM: Is that good?
 MATT: In a very unhealthy way. 
 LAURA: You know what? I think this might be worse than just like a bruised rib. Can I poke it? Does it seem infected? 
 MARISHA: Does it hurt?
 LAURA: I'm not going to poke it with my finger, though, I'm going to poke at it with a fork.
 MARISHA: Don't poke at me with a fork!
 MATT: Right now, she's inspecting it. You take a fork off the table and poke.
 MARISHA: No, you don't!
 LAURA: I'll use the blunt end, don't be such a baby!
 MATT: She pushes it in and the bruise hurts a bit. You watch as this sickly pus liquid begins to pour out, with a thick viscosity and a lot of it. You all of the sudden feel like you've punctured a balloon that’s beginning to erupt and you feel awful. Then you blink a few times and it's just a bruise. You hear this distant (cackling).
 LAURA: Oh, motherfucker, he's such a dick!
 SAM: What? Who? What? What's going on?
 MARISHA: My bruise is in the shape of a dick?
 LAURA: That would be really cool.
 MARISHA: That would be fun!
 LAURA: I'm just going make sure, I'm going to push on it a bit more. I think it's okay, you're fine.
 MARISHA: All right. I'll sleep it off.
 LAURA: I think I need some sleep, you guys. 
 LIAM: Gustav, the person who runs the circus, is he your friend?
 TALIESIN: He's family.
 LIAM: He's family? 
 TALIESIN: We take care of each other. He's a good man. 
 LIAM: So what's your play tomorrow?
 TALIESIN: Well, they have all my things and they have all family. I'm going to figure out what is going on. Try and find out what's actually doing this. I assume since it's none of us, it's going to happen again.
 LAURA: But how can we because we can't leave this tavern? 
 TALIESIN: Well, I--
 SAM: Were Caleb and I not instructed not to leave the tavern? We received no formal instruction.
 MATT: No, you weren't part of that formal instruction. The rest of you were told not to leave the tavern until further notice. 
 TALIESIN: I'm sure if we sleep on it, we'll think of something.
 LAURA: Fjord! You and I could leave in the morning the same way we got in.
 TRAVIS: That's true. 
 SAM: How'd you get in?
 LAURA: With magic. I would show you now, but I'm out of spells!
 SAM: The fork trick wasn't very fun, was it?
 LAURA: No. I was making sure she wasn't a zombie. I thought she might be.
 TALIESIN: That's fair.
 LAURA: She got clawed, right?
 TALIESIN: A bit, yeah.
 LAURA: All right. Hey bitches, I'm going to go to bed. 
 TALIESIN: Where exactly am I going to be sleeping, by the way? I mean, I can sleep down here, but it might be nice.
 TRAVIS: Molly, if you would like to share my room, you can.
 TALIESIN: Excellent. You don't mind? I'm going to pull the swords off finally and start getting comfortable out of the performance clothes. 
 MARISHA: I'm in Jester's room, still, I think. Sleeping on the floor on my bedroll.
 LAURA: As she starts to go to sleep, I want to draw in my sketchbook and tell the Traveler about all the cool things I saw for the day. I'm going to draw the red faced guard as I pretended I was a zombie, and I'm going to draw Molly's horns all full of jewels and stuff! I'm going to draw the stack of books.
 SAM: The monster attack?
 LAURA: And I'm going to draw like a zombie, but like as an old man but as he's biting his dentures fall out and he's not no teeth!
 MATT: All righty. Fairly decent sketches, actually. You eventually find yourself to sleep. The rest of you, go to your respective rooms and find yourselves falling into a night's rest. As evening comes to a close and the morning brings you to consciousness, you are rested. You are healed up, your spells are restored.
 SAM: I can use the Long Rest feature of DandD Beyond!
 MARISHA: You hit a button!
 LAURA: And all my spells back!
 TALIESIN: There is a button for it.
 SAM: Whoa, nothing changed! No spells. I lost ten hit points?! What the fuck?! I've done something terribly wrong.
 (laughter)
 TRAVIS: DandD Beyond’s watching going, “Fuck you, Nott!”
 LAURA: Wait no, you're putting temporary hit points on! What are you doing?
 SAM: We'll work on this during the break.
 LIAM: Self destruct in 10, nine.
 MARISHA: He just throws the iPad.
 MATT: Coming to consciousness in your respective rooms, cold morning air. It's a bit frosty. The windows to each of your rooms have a bit of that curled bit of frost on the outskirts of the glass. It's probably 8:00 or 9:00 in the morning at this point in time and the day is yours. What do you wish to do?
 MARISHA: As I wake up, I sit up and I go: Jester?
 LAURA: Hmm?
 MARISHA: Were you laughing to yourself last night? I just kept hearing giggling. It was obnoxious.
 LAURA: I'm sorry.
 MARISHA: Uh-huh. I just get ready.
 MATT: As a note, too, for all the drinks you guys drank last night, that probably put you back about one and a half gold.
 TRAVIS: Molly, that's your tab, right?
 TALIESIN: All but the one you bought me.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, except for that one.
 TALIESIN: To be fair, I didn't give you that story.
 TRAVIS: That's true.
 TALIESIN: I very carefully start unfolding my robe and it has my swords very carefully laid out in there from the closet. I do a little prayer and put everything back on.
 TRAVIS: Are you praying over your swords?
 TALIESIN: I am, of course.
 TRAVIS: Is that part of your thing?
 TALIESIN: You seem honest. 
 TRAVIS: I try to be.
 TALIESIN: Well, the swords are magic. According to my mum, they go back in our family generations to a very unusual rare line of tiefling that came from a demon of ice that lived inside a volcano. Our family, and I take this with a grain of salt, were royal guards, were entrusted with these magic swords and these swords can only be activated by the blood of the royal family. So in honor of any fighting I ever do with them, I make sure my blood is at least drawn once.
 TRAVIS: That's quite the story. Can I insight check him?
 MATT: Sure.
 TRAVIS: 15.
 TALIESIN: What am I fighting against?
 MATT: This would be deception.
 TALIESIN: That would be deception. All right. I'm lying like a motherfucker.
 TRAVIS: Well thank you for sharing that honest story with me, it means a lot.
 TALIESIN: I walk downstairs.
 MATT: All right.
 LAURA: Can I go knock on Fjord's door?
 MATT: Sure.
 LAURA: Ey oh ey, good morning!
 SAM: She's a morning person too? Jesus.
 TRAVIS: Ey oh ey yourself.
 LAURA: Hey, do you want to get out of here?
 TRAVIS: Yeah, we said we were going to do that, didn't we? What did you have in mind?
 LAURA: Well, we sneak out and then we go find out why there are zombies.
 TRAVIS: That's a detailed plan.
 LAURA: Yes.
 TRAVIS: I like it. Are we taking anybody with us?
 LAURA: Well, if they can make themselves not look like themselves, then sure.
 TRAVIS: Fair enough. Do you want to ask any of them?
 LAURA: Hey, Beau.
 MARISHA: Yeah.
 LAURA: Do you have anything you can do to make yourself not look like you?
 MARISHA: I take my robes and I flip them inside out and I take some dirt and dirty it up a little bit and take my hair down and I steal a scarf off of Jester's stuff and I do a bandana around my head.
 LAURA: No, you look like you with a bandana around your head.
 TRAVIS: Yeah that's not going to cut it, not quite like what we had in mind.
 LAURA: Yeah.
 MARISHA: What are you guys doing? You guys leaving? Are you guys fucking leaving? You're not leaving without me are you?
 LAURA: No, of course, we're coming back.
 MARISHA: You're skipping town.
 LAURA: No. Oh, but we could.
 TRAVIS: She's right here.
 LAURA: Okay.
 MARISHA: I could skip town with you, though. Do you want to skip town?
 LAURA: We'll be back.
 TRAVIS: Let's see if Caleb and his little friend are downstairs first. He has tricks after all.
 LAURA: Right.
 MATT: Okay, the two of you come to consciousness. What are you up to?
 SAM: Get some breakfast, I guess?
 LIAM: Yeah, we're already down there.
 MATT: You've already gone down there?
 TALIESIN: I've already gone, I'm having breakfast. I'm leaving a note with the barkeep for Yasha if she comes back.
 MATT: Okay.
 MARISHA: I guess I go down and have breakfast as well.
 MATT: As you guys wander down you find Caleb and Nott already at a table and Mollymauk returning from the bar after delivering that note.
 TRAVIS: Y'all are downstairs?
 SAM: (messy eating noises)
 LAURA: Can I try to pick a piece of bacon off your plate?
 SAM: (growls) Sure, for you.
 LAURA: Thanks.
 TRAVIS: It's like a little dog. The little back foot creeps up. (growls) If we could we're-- did you just fucking? Shit. We were thinking of maybe finding our way outside of the inn for a bit. I don't want to presume anything, but do you have the ability to change the way you look?
 LIAM: To change the way I look?
 TRAVIS: Yeah. You know
 LIAM: To leave the inn?
 TRAVIS: Yeah, assume a different form.
 LIAM: Why would I do that to leave the inn?
 LAURA: So we can find out why there are zombies.
 LIAM: Why wouldn't I just walk out of the inn?
 LAURA: Well, because we were told we can't leave the inn.
 SAM: We weren't told that.
 TRAVIS: Right.
 LAURA: Huh. Well, that's convenient.
 SAM: But I can change my appearance.
 LAURA: Wow. I would never know it was you.
 SAM: Yeah.
 TRAVIS: Molly, what about you?
 TALIESIN: Well, I mean look at me. I go into my bag. I do have a disguise kit. Don't I? I think I do. It's so weird to just have things now. Yeah, I have a disguise kit.
 TRAVIS: Fair enough.
 SAM: What does that mean?
 MATT: It means he can use to try and disguise himself. Hide features.
 TALIESIN: It'd be a little tricky for me, I'm going to look like what I'm going to look like. But the rest of you could do a little work.
 TRAVIS: Beau, I don't want to leave you behind, but I--
 LAURA: It's true, I have a disguise kit, too. I could help you out.
 MARISHA: Would you do my makeup for me?
 LAURA: I'm really good at makeup.
 MARISHA: Are you?
 LAURA: Yeah.
 MARISHA: Let's do that.
 LAURA: I'm really shit at makeup.
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: We could just shower this one that would be enough.
 LAURA: He can leave, apparently.
 LIAM: Yeah, we could. But not town, we were told to stay in town.
 LAURA: No, no, we're going to stay in town.
 SAM: What are we doing again?
 LAURA: We have to find out why there are zombies so we that don't get arrested for being zombies.
 SAM: So we solve the case to clear our own name.
 LIAM: Why shouldn't we just wait for it all to blow over? We didn't do anything.
 TALIESIN: I tend to find these things don't blow necessarily as more they just eventually decide someone's guilty and take their revenge on them.
 LIAM: Do you find yourself in situations like this often?
 TALIESIN: Not this particular one, but yes.
 MARISHA: I mean, look at him. No offense or anything.
 TALIESIN: None taken, really. A little taken, but that's fine.
 TRAVIS: He makes a point. I think that the sooner we find the cause of this, the sooner we can get out of here.
 TALIESIN: She's right, immediately the two of us are going to get hit with this.
 SAM: If we solve the case we would be absolved. It's not a terrible plan.
 MARISHA: And you're so concerned with your goblin friend. I mean he's in the same boat as the tieflings.
 LIAM: That's a girl.
 LAURA: I know it's hard to tell.
 MARISHA: I said your goblin friend.
 LAURA and LAURA: You said he.
 SAM: Listen, we've all had a rough night. I know that my features aren't necessarily the most feminine. Among goblin kind, I understand. It's hard to tell.
 LAURA: I can tell.
 LIAM: Everybody can tell.
 LAURA: Yeah.
 MARISHA: I'm working on it.
 TRAVIS: Let's get out of here. Can I walk back into a privy, washroom area?
 MATT: Yeah, upstairs at the very end of the hall is the communal washroom.
 TRAVIS: Can I use my Mask of Many Faces to cast Disguise Self on myself?
 MATT: Sure, what form so you want to take?
 TRAVIS: Older, white-haired, with a beard. Just very simple peasant's clothes. Maybe a bit of a farmer or a land worker.
 MATT: Okay, easily enough. Basic browns and tans and general farm worker's tunic and supplies.
 TRAVIS: Smudges, dirt on the fingernails.
 MATT: Yeah, easy enough.
 LAURA: I'm going to help Beau. You know what I'm going to do for you? I'm going to use my disguise kit I'm going to give you a beard.
 MARISHA: Oh, yeah!
 LAURA: Yeah and I'm going to turn you into a dude, that's a good disguise, right?
 MARISHA: Yeah.
 LAURA. Yeah, and a mustache. And a hat.
 MARISHA: Love it.
 SAM: You really have to sell it though, and act like a dude.
 MARISHA: I think I can do that.
 SAM: Oh yes!
 MARISHA: I'm going to go a step further and tape down my boobs, bandage them down all the way, you know wrap them. Stuff my crotch a little bit.
 MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a dexterity check.
 TALIESIN: Do you want assistance with this?
 LAURA: Was he helping me?
 MATT: If you want to.
 LAURA: Sure.
 MATT: So take it with advantage.
 TALIESIN: Oh, with advantage.
 LAURA: Good. Okay, with the advantage. Dexterity. 15.
 MATT: 15, okay. You actually manage to sell a decent disguise.
 MARISHA: Do I have some five o'clock shadow?
 MATT: At a distance, at like three or four feet would be passable and walking quickly by. Upon close inspection, you could see through it.
 LIAM: Is it like one of those old kids toys where you use the magnet to pull the little filings up?
 MATT: More or less.
 MARISHA: Mr. Woolly?
 MATT: A medieval version of that.
 LIAM: Herr Woolly.
 MATT: But impressive. Using the kit and using whatever scraps of clothing you can find and amass you manage to get a relatively top-knot Silverlake hobo version of Beau functionally ready to go.
 MARISHA: Wait Fjord how do you sound? Say words, you're manly.
 TRAVIS and MARISHA: Manly words. Mirror image. I got nuts.
 (laughter)
 LAURA: And I'll cast Disguise Self on myself, as well, and turn myself into a human with blonde hair and she's going to be very clean-looking.
 SAM: Angelina.
 LAURA: Yes! With big lips, and a couple jewels on her fingers. 
 MATT: Okay. Just double-checking here, Disguise Self lasts for, is it an hour? Yeah, I thought it was an hour. So while they're doing that, are you using your disguise kit on yourself?
 TALIESIN: I assume I've just got some very basic black robe that just--
 MATT: Yeah, with a cloak and hood and make-up, you can probably pass for human as long as you keep the hood up, and keep most of your more ostentatious garb hidden.
 TALIESIN: I'm sure I've got a set.
-
MATT: Go ahead and make a dexterity check for your disguise kit.
 LAURA: Do you want help?
 TALIESIN: Yes please, this is a lot of work. It's a natural 20, that'll do it. 
 MATT: All right. Between making your skin tone more of a natural tan, peach humanoid color, bring the hood up. You actually pull some of your hair forward and adhere it a bit around the horns so that it looks almost like a cluster of hair in the front. You manage to tuck in and tie your robe behind you, your usual clothing, and then using an over-robe to hide most of the material, and you look like a dude passing through. So with that your disguises are complete, your spells are cast. 
 MARISHA: Is that your human face? 
 LIAM: While they're doing all that, I want to stroll outside and see if there's crownsguard outside, or what. I'm just going to get a breath of fresh air and see what's on the street outside of this place. 
 MATT: Okay. As you exit, there are two gentlemen in full crownsguard gear. One is standing outside, the other is currently sitting in a chair, and as soon as you walk past, they both scan you up and down, continue to watch you pass by. 
 LIAM: Good. There's only just the two at the door?
 MATT: Just the two that you can see at the front, yes. 
 LIAM: Okay, all right. So I just take a minute or two. I go back inside. And-- on Nott's shoulder and say we're good, yeah, I think we're good. 
 SAM: Excellent.
 LAURA: Should we try to do this, then?
 TRAVIS: In twos, or singles. 
 LAURA: Yeah, of course, not all at the same time, that's obvious. 
 TRAVIS: Level two, trying to get out of a fucking inn. 
 MARISHA: It's so hard. 
 TALIESIN: Now I'm kicking myself. 
 MARISHA: So anxiety-inducing. 
 TALIESIN: No, never mind, I didn't do it at the time, I can't do it now. No retconning, never mind.
 LIAM: I'm going to squat down over with you, privately. I still think that this is a bad idea, but I can tell that you want to. 
 SAM: Well it's just that-- listen, there's no offense, I enjoy our talks and your schooling and everything, but I haven't talked this openly and freely with other people in months. It's amazing. 
 LIAM: It really is pretty nice, isn't it?
 SAM: Yes!
 LIAM: Still, if this goes south, we leave. 
 SAM: We're the first ones out the door. 
 LIAM: Easily. 
 SAM: Yeah. They'll never know who we were. 
 LIAM: Caleb and Nott. 
 SAM: Well, don't say that too much. I mean, yes, they do know that we're Caleb and Nott, yes. 
 LIAM: All right. 
 SAM: Okay. 
 LIAM: So we're doing this? 
 SAM: Yeah, let's just go with, and see where it leads. 
 LAURA: Can I walk up to Nott?
 SAM: Hi! Yes, we weren't talking!
 LAURA: (high-pitched) Do you like my outfit?
 SAM: Oh! What are you? I'm sorry, I'm just a young girl from the village. 
 LAURA: And I'm just a young girl from town. 
 SAM: I don't know anything. I should go get my father. 
 TRAVIS: (high-pitched) New York is where I'd rather stay!
 (laughter)
 LAURA: Nott, it's me! It's Jester!
 SAM: But you look like--
 LAURA: I know! This is how good I am at magic! Check me out. Are we leaving here or not?
 SAM: Are you afraid you'll be propositioned on the street?
 LAURA: I am really attractive right now. 
 SAM: Those lips are very big. 
 LAURA: I came over here to give you the blessing!
 SAM: What is that? What does that do?
 LAURA: It helps you with your stealthing!
 SAM: Oh, the stealthy thing, yes, thank you so much, I'll accept it. 
 LAURA: You're welcome. Okay, that's it. But I'll see you outside at some point, okay? Don't be scared, come up to me. 
 SAM and LAURA: Okay. 
 MATT: Okay, in what order are you leaving?
 TRAVIS: Should I go first? 
 LAURA: Sure!
 MARISHA: Are we going out in pairs? Like you said? (Deeper) Are we going out in pairs?
 TALIESIN: Has Adelaine noticed any of this?
 MATT: I imagine you guys have been using your disguise kits in your own rooms and chambers. Other than that, no one immediately seems to be noticing. Make a perception check. 
 TRAVIS: Not command ops in the tavern hall. 
 TALIESIN: Let's call that a--
 LAURA: 14!
 TALIESIN: 14, thank you. 
 MATT: You do see Yorda, the barkeep, in the process of wiping out some glasses at the end, she's occasionally giving a glance over to you guys as you're walking around. 
 LAURA: (whispering) You go first!
 TRAVIS: You want to come with?
 MARISHA: Yeah. 
 TRAVIS: Don't do anything stupid. Mouth shut, eyes forward. Show me how you walk. Maybe a little less. That's nice. I also assume a little limp, slight. 
 MATT: I'll say for the purpose of this, each of you make a performance check. 
 LAURA: Oh, god. 
 TRAVIS: 20. 
 MARISHA: 16. 
 MATT: Okay. The both of you exit out, holding your breath. Out of your peripheral you can see the deep reds and golds of the crownsguard armor flanking you as you breach the outer porch of the tavern, stepping down into the dust to the main street. You curve to the left and see nor hear any reaction from either of them. 
 TRAVIS: Just keep moving to the other side of the street. 
 TALIESIN: I go single just a little bit after, and I rolled a natural 20. 
 SAM: Is that three for the night?
 TALIESIN: Yep. 
 SAM: Oh my god. 
 TRAVIS: What color is that die?
 TALIESIN: It seems to be iron, like my will. 
 MATT: It may not have been the snitch after all, you asshole. 
 TALIESIN: Me and my magic swords. 
 MATT: Apparently. All right, you saunter by without an issue. By saunter, I mean you stumble through. You hear a cough at one point, and it causes you a moment, but you just continue on without notice. 
 LAURA: Oh, everybody's leaving and I didn't have a partner!
 MARISHA: It's fine, don't worry about it. 
 SAM: You can come with us, if you like. 
 LAURA: But I feel like you guys are noticeable and why would I be this really beautiful woman leaving with the stinky guy?
 SAM: It's quickly becoming canon that you just have shit smeared all over you. You could travel with me! I could be your daughter. 
 LAURA: You're my daughter!
 SAM: Yes! We're a couple, and he's our guard or something, I don't know. 
 LAURA: Yeah! You leave after us Caleb, okay?
 LIAM: Isn't it simpler for you to walk on yourself like a beautiful woman?
 LAURA: No, me and Nott are going to go together. Okay, come on, Nott!
 SAM: I'm sorry, she's very forward.
 LAURA: Come on sweetie, let's go.
 SAM: Yes, mommy!
 LAURA: And we walk out. 
 MATT: You guys don't have to make a performance check because you've exited before, and you're completely visually a different individual, so you guys pass through without an issue. Caleb, you can follow up behind, as you are not currently under direct guard in the tavern. They do notice you exit, and they're aware of your presence, but you are not confined to the tavern. So you guys all manage to slowly come together a few blocks down and out of the sight of the crownsguard guarding the Nestled Nook Inn, and where are you off to?
 LAURA: We did it! Where should we go?
 TRAVIS: Let's just keep walking for now. 
 LAURA: Okay. Should we walk toward the carnival where the zombies were?
 TALIESIN: Who was he, would be my question. 
 LAURA: Oh, right. We should find out where he's from. How do we do that? Should we ask around and say hey, anybody know where the old guy came from that turned into a zombie?
 TRAVIS: That's a good point. 
 TALIESIN: Seems to be the most appropriate thing to ask at this point
 LIAM: Well, we could find some public places and just gossip a bit, see if anybody has heard of him, if a friend has died at the circus last night. 
 MARISHA: I mean, you mentioned no sick people. If he was sick, sometimes that word gets around. 
 TRAVIS: Maybe there is a morgue, maybe they recognized him.
 TALIESIN: These small towns, most everyone knows everyone else. 
 LAURA: Let's go to, is there a market area?
 MATT: They don't have a large bazaar, but there is an area that is generally where a lot of the simple wares and vegetables and meats and people who sell small things that they craft their own at, it's a small market. If you want to make an investigation check. 
 LAURA: 16.
 MATT: Okay, by going around asking questions and inquiring and trying to prod people to talk about what transpired the night before, the information you gather involves the man who passed away. His name is Enon Brinjay.
 LIAM: Brinjay?
 MATT: Brinjay. He's a standard human being in his early 80s. He's old, but healthy, it seemed. 
 TRAVIS: Was he in good health?
 MATT: Seemed to be in good health for his age.
 LIAM: So the war against the old continues.
 MATT: Apparently. 
 TALIESIN: We’re the Logan's Run of DandD.
 MATT: He seemed to have been retired for quite some time, but had been making little bits here and there, helping the fishermen move fish to and from the outside of the lake. He wasn't really well known. The reason people are talking about him now is because the word is gotten around and gossiped about, but for the most part, he was one of the many faceless people that live in the town. A handful knew his name.
 TALIESIN: Retired fisherman?
 MARISHA: He was helping.
 TALIESIN: Do we know where he was retired from and where he was staying, maybe where he was drinking? He had to go somewhere.
 MATT: Actually, he was known often to be drinking at The Old Mud Hole Tavern.
 TALIESIN: Is that with the weird "e" spelling?
 MATT: No, just "old."
 TALIESIN: I'm always a fan.
 MATT: I know.
 LAURA: "Ye olde."
 TALIESIN: "Ye olde" It's pronounced "the" when you see the ye.
 TRAVIS: I should point out this is the second connection to the Ustaloch.
 TALIESIN: The what?
 TRAVIS: Well, before we met up with you two, we fought off a wicked, sick water snake.
 LAURA: It came up out of the lake for some reason.
 TALIESIN: Is this a metaphor or is this actually a real thing?
 LAURA: It really happened. I almost died.
 MARISHA: I punched a snake to death.
 LAURA: She did.
 SAM: There were the snakes in the circus last night, but it wasn't related to the attack, I suppose.
 LAURA: A little different.
 LIAM: How long of a snake are we talking about? 
 MARISHA: Oh, it was a giant water snake, then the little girls were complaining about more and more instances of these snakes coming out of the lake.
 SAM: And this fellow who died worked with the fishermen in the lake?
 LAURA: Well, he took some jobs with them. Did anybody see him the day of the carnival? Was he working with anyone that day?
 MATT: You don't find any of that information. That would be an intense investigation. You would have to go beyond asking questions around a market.
 SAM: Is the lake within the city limits?
 MARISHA: Yeah.
 MATT: It's technically considered part of the city. It might not be an issue.
 LAURA: Where's Ye Olde Mud Hole Tavern at?
 MATT: The Mud Hole Tavern, you've been to before.
 TALIESIN: I was doing my rounds.
 MATT: Yeah, when you first entered the city, so you can--
 MARISHA: The Lochward, is that what we're talking about?
 MATT: The Lochward is where the Old Mud Hole would be at. The Lochward is to the eastern side of the entire city. The Lochward is the central one.
 LIAM: The wards border the lake.
 MATT: So you make your way to the Old Mud Hole. Entering inside, this is a dark dive of a bar, you've been there once before. It smells heavily of old, wet wood, ale stains, and peanut. It's a very small area and of the four tables that are there, they are mostly empty, except for one old man who is sitting there in the process of playing a game of solitaire with his cards and a man in his 30s thumbing through a book, who would be the barkeep if there were more patrons at the moment. He's flipping through and glances up and gives you a look as you enter. "Can I help you? Are you looking for drinks? Can I get you anything?"
 LIAM: Yeah, I would really love a drink and I sit down next to him. What do you have? I need something heavier than a trost. I've had enough trosts to last me a lifetime.
 MATT: "We have liquor."
 LIAM: I will take your liquor.
 MATT: "I will get some whiskey for you then. Whiskey, everyone?"
 MARISHA: Sure.
 SAM: Two please.
 LAURA: It's okay. She's my daughter. She loves whiskey. I don't even remember what voice I was doing. 
 MATT: Make a deception check.
 LAURA: I let her have any whiskey she wants. Oh, that's pretty good. 17.
 TALIESIN: We've been doing a pub crawl.
 MATT: He goes and lines up a few small containers, fills whiskey for all of you. "All right, that will be eight silver for the batch."
 LIAM: I have that. I pull out eight silver. Oh wait, silver, did you say? I do not have eight silver.
 LAURA: It's okay. I have it.
 LIAM: You do?
 LAURA: Sure. I mean, sure.
 MATT: He takes the silver and puts it away, slides the drinks to the rest of you and goes back to his book and starts thumbing through again.
 LIAM: Honestly, it's been a terrible 24 hours. We were at the circus last night and I did not know him well, but old man Brinjay fell.
 MATT: He looks up and goes, "Enon, it's sad to see him go and many of us were wondering what day it was going to be."
 LIAM: Did you know him?
 MATT: "He came in here most every day to drink. He's a lonely man."
 LIAM: It was a terrible way to go. I'm sorry.
 MATT: "Doesn't bother me one way or the other. Just sad to lose a patron."
 LAURA: Do you know who was talking to him the day of the carnival?
 MATT: "I don't recall. Sometimes he would tell stories to whoever was willing to listen and not most were willing to listen."
 LAURA: Was he here that day?
 MATT: "Yesterday?"
 LAURA: Yeah.
 MATT: "I think he came in briefly for a drink before the carnival, but that was it."
 MARISHA: You know, we should drink to old stories of Brinjay.
 TRAVIS: (shushes)
 TALIESIN: I down my shot. What did the man drink out of curiosity? What was his final drink? I'm a bit of a macabre person myself.
 MATT: "It's this very whiskey you just had."
 TALIESIN: I'll take one more, and I'll get one of my own.
 LIAM: I heard he was sick, too.
 MATT: "I don't believe he was ill. I hope not. He seemed to be rather wasting away. You shouldn't be doing so much manual labor at that age."
 SAM: What labor was he doing?
 MATT: "He carries stuff around from small tasks to--
 SAM: Down at the docks?
 MATT: "The docks, up at the North Ward. He carried crates, boxes. Just odd jobs, ways to get by til the end of his days, which now that they've come, may he rest and not have to do odd jobs ever again." He pours his own bit of whiskey.
 ALL: Cheers.
 LAURA: Do you know who he was doing odd jobs for that day?
 SAM: Your lady voice is worse than mine.
 MATT: "To be honest, if he did, I wasn't paying attention."
 LIAM: I'm sure his family will miss him very much.
 MATT: "There's nobody nearby. He had a son about 35 years ago, but he got married and went up north."
 TRAVIS: Did he work for any of the particular breweries somehow?
 MATT: "I don't know. Maybe."
 MARISHA: Brinjay.
 LAURA: Where did he sit in here?
 MATT: He points over to the not the table the guy is playing solitaire on, but the empty table to the right of him. "Usually right there in the corner."
 LAURA: I go sit in the corner. I'm going to look if I can find that looks like an old man was touching it. 
 MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.
 LAURA: Okay. I'm really good at this. 12.
 MATT: 12. It looks like probably old person touching has been all over here. Yes. The table is very old and warped in places, stains all over it. It's not a very good table. It’s seen some rough days.
 TRAVIS: If we were to go down to the docks and ask after a few people he worked with, is there anyone you know that we should speak to, familiar of his?
 MATT: "I apologize. I served him drinks and pretended to listen to him many times, but I wasn't really paying attention."
 TRAVIS: Right, I understand.
 MARISHA: Is there anyone who did? That wasn't hypothetical.
 MATT: "Maybe. I apologize. I spend most of my days reading." He lifts the book.
 MARISHA: What's the book?
 SAM: You read!
 LIAM: Subtle, guys.
 TALIESIN: We got a reader. While they're doing this, I'm going to saunter over to the card player.
 LIAM: Can I see what's on the spine of that book from where I am?
 MATT: At a glance at it, it's in Zemnian, which you can read. The translation would come about to The Rosed Embrace.
 MARISHA: A romance novel.
 MATT: Probably.
 LAURA: Is Fabio on the cover?
 LIAM: How's your trashy novel? It’s a good one. No judgement.
 MATT: "It's not trashy. It's very tasteful."
 LIAM: Oh no, I'm fluent in Zemnian. I've read all of his works.
 MATT: "Have you?"
 LIAM: Mutual fan.
 MATT: "I didn't realize there was another Samuel fan in here. Which is your favorite?"
 LIAM: I love the Farthing’s Embrace.
 MATT: "I haven't read that one."
 LIAM: It's an early one. He actually did it under a pseudonym. He did a whole series under that pseudonym, short stories.
 MATT: "What is it again?" He goes over and grabs a piece of chalk in the back and starts, "It was?"
 LIAM: Farthing’s Embrace.
 MATT: "Mein Gott, I did not know about this. I may have to send out Zadash and see if we can find some of those books. Thank you.”
 LIAM: You're a big reader or just Samuel?
 MATT: "Just recently Samuel. I read on occasion. It depends on what you can find."
 LIAM: I read a lot, but all I've been able to find in this town is that parchment place.
 MATT: "The parchment place is good for trash. If you're looking for unique stuff, there's a few places you can go."
 LIAM: Here in town?
 MATT: "Here in town, yeah. If you're having a hard time finding a specific book, I would recommend going to Burnished Bibelots."
 LIAM: Burnished Bibelots. Which ward is that in?
 MATT: "That is in the North Ward, just on the outskirts of the main market street. It's a bit of a cluttered mess, but Oglen would be happy to help you.
 LIAM: Oglen?
 MATT: "Oglen."
 LIAM: That is good to know. Thank you.
 MATT: "Not to worry."
 LIAM: Those are hard to find, the Farthing’s Embrace.
 MATT: "I imagine so. It can't be that bad."
 LIAM: He wasn't as proud of them. Early work and all that.
 MATT: "Of course. I have a contact in Rexxentrum. If I cannot find it in Zadash, I will get it from Rexxentrum.
 LIAM: That would be the place.
 MATT: "What's your name?"
 LIAM: My name is Caleb.
 MATT: "Caleb. Pleasure to meet you. I am Vosna.”
 TRAVIS: Thank you for the drink, Vosna. I'll be taking my leave now.
 MATT: "Of course. If anybody else is a reader as well, come by and talk sometime."
 TALIESIN: Not there at all.
 LIAM: This has been quite a day.
 LAURA: Is there pictures?
 MATT: "Pictures are up in here."
 LAURA: Oh. Sounds exciting.
 LIAM: I sneak my undrunk whiskey to Nott.
 SAM: I take out my flask from my leg, unscrew it, and pour it in.
 MATT: Okay.
 LAURA: What do you guys think? Should we stay here? Should we go somewhere else?
 TRAVIS: We got to get Molly.
 TALIESIN: I just sat down for a moment with this solitaire player.
 MATT: Correct.
 TALIESIN: They say that solitaire is the game for the death-obsessed. There's inevitability to every hand, most of them are doomed from the start no matter what you do. Any interest to buck fate and try your hand at an opponent for once? No money, just friendly. I slide the rest of my whiskey over.
 MATT: "Are you a devil?"
 TALIESIN: I've been called worse.
 MATT: "I don't play with devils."
 TALIESIN: I'm just a man who saw another man die yesterday. It's been heavy on my conscience and I was just wondering if there was anything you could tell me about Enon.
 MATT: "Enon wanted to go to that bloody circus."
 TALIESIN: I'm regretting it myself.
 MATT: "I told him not to go. Stupid, it is for the common folk and the young. He's always had his head in the clouds."
 TALIESIN: Has he? That's not what other people have said.
 MATT: "Other people are stupid."
 TALIESIN: Why do you think he went? Why do you think that happened to him?
 MATT: "He's lonely. Don't trust the carnival. Nothing but spooks and magicians and things that want to take your life and take your money, take your family, whisk you away. Fuck the circus."
 TALIESIN: Fuck the circus. So that's what you think happened to him, then? I feel like there's something evil afoot.
 MATT: "Says the devil."
 TALIESIN: Again, I've been called worse. Sure you have in your time, as well.
 MATT: He takes the drink, sips it. "Don't come ‘round here no more."
 TALIESIN: I take my cup back. Down it. I love small towns.
 MARISHA: Shithead.
 TRAVIS: We head outside. Well, that was revealing.
 SAM: Was it?
 MARISHA: We learned a few things, actually. He's a prime target. Perfect victim, perfect candidate. No one really paid attention to him, he was old, he had no family, his son's gone. 
 TALIESIN: Awfully convenient. 
 MARISHA: Awfully convenient. Still awfully convenient that your little circus doesn't allow the elderly, which you never fully explained, and he happened to be one of the oldest people in that circus. Where did that rule come from? The sick makes sense, I asked you that before, but why elderly?
 TALIESIN: That rule's been around for as long as I can remember because it makes people think the show's dangerous. Gives them a thrill.
 TRAVIS: You're worried about them having a heart attack or something?
 TALIESIN: We're not really worried about people having a heart attack; we want people to be worried about having a heart attack, because then they're more excited to come see the show. This is how these shows work.
 MARISHA: Do you know who implemented that rule?
 TALIESIN: Before my time.
 LAURA: In his defense, every carnival I've gone to has said no sick people, no old people.
 TALIESIN: It's a boilerplate.
 MARISHA: Still a good candidate.
 TALIESIN: If you were trying to hide doing something to someone it's a great candidate. If I was trying to get away with something, terrible idea.
 MARISHA: Or if you were trying to frame someone. Seems to be a lot of pretty bigoted people in this town who don't like tieflings and other strange lots. Jester, you actually said one of the smartest things of the night, which is-- you did, yeah. Which is, guard's really weird.
 LAURA: Right?
 MARISHA: Yeah.
 TALIESIN: Wait, what?
 LAURA: The guards are really weird.
 MARISHA: The Crownsguards. As you were saying, the Ustaloch?
 TALIESIN: What kind of weird?
 LAURA: Like, you know, they-- What kind of weird?
 (laughter)
 MARISHA: They seem to be the one connecting through-line. Also, what's her name, Norda? Mentioned that she didn't want to let you lot in, but made an exception. I don't know, if I wanted to do something, and if I already knew a bunch of people were upset and angry at a circus and strange people coming in, it's easy framing, in my opinion.
 TRAVIS: She makes a valid point, actually.
 LAURA. Oh. If people are scared of carnivals, they won't want them in the future.
 TRAVIS: Bingo.
 MARISHA: That, or if you're up to no good and you don't want to get caught, blame it on the easy frame. The weirdos who just rolled into town.
 LAURA: Great, so we just need to investigate the guards.
 TRAVIS: That might be harder to do. Maybe we go down to the Lochward.
 TALIESIN: Start at the docks, but I'll keep that in mind.
 MARISHA: I don't know, it might not be the guards. There might be another through-line that we're missing.
 LAURA: Do we need to question the guards?
 SAM: That sounds terrible.
 LAURA: Maybe we should tell them they can't leave town.
 MARISHA: Ooh, that's a good idea, yeah! Maybe when they question us--
 LAURA: We turn it around!
 MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah!
 MARISHA: I like that.
 TALIESIN: I was about-- nope, nevermind.
 LAURA: What?
 TALIESIN: I was about to be very impressed, but I take it back.
 MARISHA: Aw.
 TRAVIS: How far is it from where we are to the Lochward?
 MATT: You guys are technically in the Lochward. It's a quick jaunt over to the edge of the Ustaloch.
 MARISHA: So the Ustaloch is the docks? It's what they called the ward, or it's the lake?
 MATT: It's the giant lake that the docks are up against. The city is built against this giant, kidney bean-shaped lake.
 MARISHA: What does "usta" mean? What does "usta" come from?
 MATT: Do you speak Zemnian?
 MARISHA: You speak Zemnian.
 LIAM: I do speak Zemnian.
 TALIESIN: What does "usta" mean?
 LIAM: It means--
 MATT: Do you know?
 LIAM: Do I know? 
 MATT: I just wanted to fuck with you.
 LIAM: It's been a while, but osten means lake. No, it's not Lake Lake.
 MATT: Essentially, it just means "an east lake."
 LIAM and MARISHA: East Lake. 
 TALIESIN: Very good.
 MATT: Not too complicated.
 MARISHA: All right.
 TALIESIN: I'd like to avoid the guards for as long as possible.
 MARISHA: Agreed.
 TRAVIS: Let's head down to the docks. Keeping an eye out for crownsguard.
 MATT: As you guys make your way towards the Ustaloch and the Dockward there, we'll go and take a break. We’ll be back in a few minutes. We’ll continue to unveil this mystery.
 SAM: This is exciting. Gripping.
 MATT: Indeed. I suppose. Little low level mystery here. We'll see where this goes. All right guys, back here in a few minutes. We're going to take a quick restroom break, pick it up from here. We have video at the break for this week's contest, so if you're watching on Twitch, feel free to go ahead and pay attention to get the password and enter this contest, and we'll have the victor at the end of the break. We'll be back here in a few minutes, and we'll see you then.
 
 Part II Edit 
 MATT: Welcome back, everyone. Before we dive in, real fast, we do have a winner from the chat. Thanks, Sam. Congratulations to AvilynRain, AvilynRain in the Twitch chat! You won the awesome Wyrmwood prize package. Danoba will be in contact with you to get your contact information and get that sent out to you. Congratulations.
 MARISHA: I love how we just went through every rain song in about 30 seconds.
 MATT: Yeah we did! Most of them. As you guys make your way across the streets of the Lochward, you find yourself to the docks, which are about five or six main dock structures that protrude anywhere from ten to 30 or so feet into the loch itself. There are no major ships. The biggest river that exits the loch heads towards the mountains, so there is no direct path to the inlet. All the boats in here are small fishermen's boats; they're designed specifically for the lake, for freshwater fishing and whatever needs to be transferred from bank to bank. As you approach, you can see a good amount of the boats are still out on the water. You can look out and see the outline of them against the horizon. You see a couple of small landmasses in the center of the loch, that are barely out of view. You approach, and the first couple of fishermen that walk past you both look to be hardened in their years. Their skin is very battered by the sun, it's wrinkled and dark from constant beating of the sky upon them. They glance over at this unique-looking troupe as they approach. They stop and don't say anything, they just look at you like "What are you doing here?"
 LAURA: Do we still have Disguise Self up?
 MATT: You have it for maybe ten more minutes.
 MARISHA: Oh shit.
 TRAVIS: Do we see any King's Guard? Crownsguard?
 MATT: Crownsguard? Make a perception check.
 LAURA: 11.
 TRAVIS: 11, same.
 MATT: Glancing about, you don't see any crownsguard in the immediate vicinity of the Lochward. You've seen them, they patrol the town and walk through, ward to ward, but you don't see any at the moment, no.
 LAURA: Looks like we're ahead of them in the investigation.
 MARISHA: Hey, Jester. Do you happen to remember the name of that guy whose daughter we saved from the snake?
 LAURA: Oh shit.
 MARISHA: Yeah.
 LAURA: Let's see if I wrote it down in my sketchbook.
 MARISHA: Yeah, because I didn't write it down.
 LAURA: King Bertrand?
 TRAVIS: No.
 LAURA: Okay. What about-- no, I know that guy. Nope, I didn't.
 MARISHA: Damn it.
 MATT: You remember where he lives, mostly, because you were there.
 MARISHA: That's true.
 LAURA: We could go by there.
 MARISHA: We could go by. He seems to like us.
 LAURA: He worked out there, right?
 MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah.
 MATT: You guys make your way along the edge of the loch to the outside of the fisherman's house. The house is currently being repaired. You can see in the main doorway, the door is off the hinges, and there's a large pile of ruined furniture and cabinets that have been shifted out of the building. You can also see a *long* serpentine body that is currently being skinned by a younger man, probably 14 or 15. He's in the process of carving the skin off of it. This thing is about 20 to 25 feet long.
 MARISHA: That's the snake I punched.
 LIAM: That's your work? That's impressive. You took it all by yourself?
 MARISHA: Well, no. They helped me. I'm not an egomaniac. They fucking helped me.
 LIAM: But I saw your guns last night. You probably took the lead.
 MARISHA: Give credit to the whole damn group, move on.
 TRAVIS: Flattery got you nowhere.
 TALIESIN: I'm comparing the snake to the snake that's tattooed on my hand to try and get the heads to be the exact same size.
 LIAM: We have been in the woods for too long. I've forgotten how to talk to people.
 SAM: Your game is really suffering.
 MARISHA: Thanks for the damn compliment.
 MATT: As you approach, the young man with this large, sharpened knife-- it looks like it may have been a heavy butchering knife that he's using to fillet and pull the skin off the snake. Looks back at you guys and doesn't know what's going on. You hear a voice go, "Hey!" You look up and you see the fisherman that you saw before, the one who came to you guys in the tavern. He's up on top of the roof, and he's currently boarding some portions of it. It looks like a part of the roof had been damaged in the fray. He goes, "Hold on," gets up, and comes down the ladder on the side and approaches. You can see he's sweating. "I'm so sorry, I didn't know you were coming. What can I do for you?"
 MARISHA: Sorry for dropping in.
 LAURA: Do we look like ourselves yet?
 MATT: No, actually. This is an interesting point.
 TRAVIS: Damn it.
 SAM: Wait. None of you look the same.
 MATT: That's right, no, thank you for reminding me. He comes out and he goes, "How can I help you?"
 (laughter)
 LAURA: It's us!
 MARISHA: Yeah, it's me. I pull the hat off and pull my hair up. It's Beauregard. We killed your snake?
 LAURA: (in normal voice) Pretend that I don't talk-- (in human accent) Pretend that I don't talk like this.
 TRAVIS: I drop Disguise Self.
 MATT: He goes,"Ah!"
 TRAVIS: I'm sorry to deceive you.
 MATT: I'm very confused.
 MARISHA: Oh no. Don't worry about it. What was your name, friend?
 MATT: "Rinaldo."
 MARISHA: Rinaldo! That's what it was. I knew it was an R! Okay, Rinaldo.
 TRAVIS: Rinaldo, this snake that was in your house is not the only strange occurrence that's been happening. We're trying to find out the cause of it. Have you seen anything else like this in the time that's passed?
 MATT: "No, we've been doing repairs on the house and getting everything underway. This is the first thing that's come on this side. Most of them live toward the center of the lake and stay underwater. It's been two in the last few months that have come up. It's a bit of a nuisance."
 LAURA: Have you seen any zombies coming out of the lake?
 MATT: "Zombies? What are you talking about?"
 TRAVIS: We're asking after a man that helped down at the docks, named Enon. Have you heard of him?
 MATT: "Enon?"
 TRAVIS: Enon.
 MATT: "Yeah, I worked with him a couple times. He comes through, looking for work, asking to see what's available."
 LIAM: You obviously have not heard the news from the traveling circus in town. From last night.
 MATT: "No. That's the big blue tent, right?"
 LIAM: That's correct.
 MATT: "No, what's going on?"
 LAURA: (whispering) Enon turned into a zombie.
 SAM: What?
 LAURA: (louder) Enon turned into a zombie! (whispering) And was killed.
 SAM: What?
 MATT: "I'm sorry to hear that. That's terrible. Wow, that's really terrible. I'm sorry."
 TRAVIS: We were trying to see if he might have worked with people that might have known what he was doing that day, earlier.
 MATT: "I haven't seen him at the docks in a while. Not for a week, at least."
 TRAVIS and LAURA: Really?
 LIAM: Is there anything out of the ordinary from the past week or two that comes to mind? Anything off about the run-of-the-mill stuff?
 MATT: "Other than a giant fucking snake ruining my house, but not that comes to mind, no. Circus coming into town, that's a little weird."
 TRAVIS: I see you're skinning the beast. Can I ask why?
 MATT: "I'm not going to let it go to waste. That's some good meat. Some good skin."
 MARISHA: You mentioned the circus coming to town as weird. Why?
 MATT: "Because there's a circus in town."
 LIAM: He just means out of the ordinary, yeah?
 MATT: "Yeah. We don't get many shows and traveling folk. Last time this was here, a year ago, it came and went in a week."
 SAM: You said you hadn't seen this-- hi. You said you hadn't seen this person in a week? Was that unusual?
 MATT: "No. I didn't keep up with him. He came through every now and then. I had a little cash and needed some help hauling things around. I asked for his assistance. He was an old fella, and it was less that he was helpful and more that we wanted to help when we could."
 TRAVIS: If we went down to the docks where he worked, is there anyone that we should ask for, to speak to, who might have known him better?
 MATT: "Your guess is as good as mine. To be fair, although we're a community, we're also relatively competitive. You understand."
 TRAVIS: I do.
 TALIESIN: You think anyone would have wanted him marked or harmed in some way?
 MATT: "I don't think so. He's an old man. I haven't seen or heard anyone-- his disposition seemed positive enough, if a little sad and lonely."
 TRAVIS: If you think of anything, or if you hear anyone speak about him, you can find us at the Nestled Nook Inn. We'd appreciate anything, if it happens to reach your ears.
 MATT: "Of course. Let me finish up here with the roof and I'll ask around, see if anything comes up."
 TRAVIS: Much obliged.
 MARISHA: How's your little girl doing? Sorry, I cover my beard.
 MATT: "It just wasn't expected."
 MARISHA: Sorry.
 MATT: "No, she's doing great. She's been a little spooked, but she slept well last night. She's doing fine. Thank you again for what you guys did for me."
 LAURA: You're welcome.
 SAM: What? For what?
 LAURA: We saved a little girl!
 SAM: Oh yes, that's right.
 LAURA: If you see any zombies, please let us know.
 MATT: "I will. You were so kind to help me when I saw a snake, I figure if I see a zombie, you'd also be helpful."
 LAURA: We would, definitely. We already killed a zombie too!
 TALIESIN: This is just a snake. This is a big, weird snake I'm looking at?
 MATT: You can inspect it if you want.
 TALIESIN: No, I've been looking at the snake this entire time.
 LAURA: Oh, we have one of its fangs. I pulled it out.
 MATT: Make a nature check.
 SAM: Ooh, don't do those much either.
 MARISHA: I have a fang too, right?
 TALIESIN: Nine.
 MATT: Nine? You don't know much about snake biology. It's hard to tell if it's out of the ordinary. It's just a big snake.
 TALIESIN: Looks like mine.
 LAURA: Only bigger.
 TALIESIN: Much bigger.
 TRAVIS: Shall we?
 LAURA: Fuck. Sure.
 SAM: We are the best detectives ever.
 LAURA: I feel like we are really doing bad at this detective thing.
 TRAVIS: We should probably wrap up whatever we're doing. I imagine they're going to come by the inn soon and try and speak with us. Not you two.
 SAM: We didn’t leave any sort of Ferris Bueller-y thing?
 TRAVIS: Nope. No stuffed beds, no recordings on the old VHS.
 MATT: What are you guys doing? Where are you going?
 SAM: Is there anywhere else that we need to inspect? The carnival or more docks stuff?
 LAURA: I feel like going back to the carnival is probably a bad idea.
 TALIESIN: I'd say the docks are his home, if we could figure out where he lived.
 SAM: Where he was last seen.
 TALIESIN: He was last seen at the circus!
 LAURA: Rinaldo!
 MATT: "Yeah?"
 LAURA: Do you know where Enon lives?
 MATT: "I can't say I do. I'm sorry. My apologies. Wish I could be of more help."
 LAURA: It's okay.
 TALIESIN: You don't happen to know what happened to his son, by any chance?
 MATT: "I didn't even know he had a son."
 LAURA: See? We're better investigators than this guy.
 SAM: But he's not trying to investigate!
 TALIESIN: I take the compliment. I'm putting it my pocket. I'm keeping it for later.
 MATT: He climbs back up the ladder to the roof.
 MARISHA: I'm starting to think that following Enon's story isn't necessarily going to lead us here. He seems like a random victim.
 LAURA: Hey, 14 year old kid!
 MATT: He has this puffy red 'fro going on. He looks pale, fresh to this, scrawny. He's stopped drawing his blade across the snake. "Yeah?"
 LAURA: Do you live here?
 MATT: "No, I live about three houses up."
 LAURA: Did you go to the carnival?
 MATT: "Last night? Yeah, I was there."
 LAURA: Okay, where were you at the carnival?
 MATT: "I actually snuck in under the tent after it had started.”
 LAURA: Right, that's a good thing. Were you close to Enon? In the show. Were you on that side or the other side? Did you see the zombie?
 MATT: "I saw him a little bit. He was in the front and I had people in front of me, but I think I saw some of it. It was pretty cool."
 LAURA: It was kind of crazy, right? Have you heard any ghost stories around town lately? About scary things happening?
 MATT: "My grandma told me a ghost story years ago about these giant badger creatures that live on the hills of the Ashkeeper that can stand up on their hind legs, and they come down and they eat kids that don't go to bed in time.
 LAURA: Oh shit. Those guys are scary, I've heard of them. You should be really careful. Have you heard anything about zombies?
 MATT: "No, not since that."
 LIAM: What's up?
 LAURA: Caleb has seen some shit.
 MATT: "I have to finish the--"
 LAURA: Hey, listen, if you hear any other ghost stories, you come and find us, okay?
 MATT: “Okay.”
 LAURA: All right.
 (laughter)
 MARISHA: Are we just going from person to person in town telling them to come find us?
 SAM: We are really terrible at this!
 TALIESIN: Well, she's making friends with everybody. I don't see any of you making friends.
 TRAVIS: I'm a little concerned that we've been gone for a while.
 MARISHA: Yeah, maybe we should get back.
 TRAVIS: Maybe let these two, that aren’t under house arrest--
 SAM: Continue the investigation? Or go back?
 TRAVIS: No, continue. I mean, if you're up for it.
 SAM: Yeah, yeah, We'll be a regular--
 LIAM: Yeah, we've done nothing wrong. We're not sweating it. I’m not sweating--
 LAURA: Yeah, I believe you completely. That was very believable. I'm going to give you another blessing before you leave, okay?
 LIAM: What are you talking about? None of us did anything. None of us! We protected the people of this town!
 LAURA: It's true. 
 LIAM: It is true.
 LAURA: I know.
 LIAM: That's easy. Let's go solve a mystery, Nott.
 SAM: All right.
 TALIESIN: Were you being sarcastic-- oh, no you weren't, okay. Catching up on that.
 MARISHA: So, kids don't know anything about this, old people don't know anything about this--
 TRAVIS: Tavern-keeper doesn't know anything about this.
 TALIESIN: Only the pure of heart make their answer out of riddles. Back to the tavern.
 MARISHA: But pure of heart! Still going back to the guards thing! Back to the tavern, let's go.
 SAM: Were we just on the docks?
 MATT: Yeah, you guys were at the docks.
 LIAM: We came up with bupkus.
 LAURA: We didn't ask anybody, we went straight to the house.
 SAM: Okay, we'll walk around the docks and look for--
 TRAVIS: We'll see you back at the inn.
 SAM: All right.
 LAURA: Should we run back, or should we saunter back?
 TALIESIN: You're going to probably, you know, poof.
 MARISHA: Yeah, how much time does she have?
 LIAM: About a minute?
 MATT: Yeah, it's about to fade.
 LAURA: Yeah, I figured it had already happened probably midway talking to the kid.
 MATT: Probably.
 MARISHA: Maybe super stealthily back?
 LAURA: All right. I put my hood up.
 TALIESIN: I can maybe put a rope through the window.
 MARISHA: Yeah, that's a good idea.
 LAURA: Is it a two-story?
 MATT: It's a two-story. You guys are up in the second story. 
 TALIESIN: I got rope.
 LAURA: Let's do that, yeah. We'll sneak around the back of the inn, and try to climb up the upstairs window.
 TRAVIS: I can keep them busy at the front door.
 TALIESIN: I'll go through the front like a proper person.
 MATT: All right, so you guys are setting up a rope to climb up the back? You go in, on your own, up to the top, you put a rope through--
 MARISHA: Fjord's distracting.
 LAURA: In the front. Then we're going to try to sneak--
 TALIESIN: Right, and then I'm going to drop some of the rope out the back window for them.
 MATT: Easy enough to do, so those of you who want to wait and can take the rope up, you wait for a moment where nobody's watching and climb your way up into the inn safely and get to your rooms. You two, what are you doing?
 TALIESIN: (singing) 50 feet of hemp rope, it’s a standard!
 LIAM: Hey kiddo, do you want a piggy-back?
 SAM: Sure, that sounds like a good idea.
 LIAM: Scramble up, let's go talk to some people.
 SAM: All right, I'll jump on Caleb's back.
 MATT: All right.
 LIAM: I'll wander down to where people are working. Where people are moving crates around.
 MARISHA: He’s on Caleb’s back!
 MATT: Okay, that would be probably closer to the Northward.
 LIAM: Okay, so that's the plan, is to look for people moving crap around, the same way that Enon is said to have. So that's what we'll do.
 MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.
 LIAM: All right.
 SAM: Shall I help, or no?
 MATT: If you want to.
 LIAM: Not that great.
 MATT: You aiding him would give him an advantage in the roll.
 LIAM: Oh! That didn't help. 12 for me.
 MATT: You take a couple hours wandering through the Northward, asking questions, and most of the information you get is, they have no idea who that is, or like, "Ah, he died? It's about time."
 LIAM: And there's no point even asking questions because we've asked them all for two hours, yeah?
 MATT: I'd say yeah, based on that roll.
 LIAM: Okay, well that's a big zero. You want to go book shopping with me?
 SAM: Sure!
 LIAM: Okay. I believe that gentleman said that the Burnished Bibliots was in the Northward, correct?
 MATT: I believe you are correct. Yeah, it's in the southern portion of the Northward by where it borders the Lochward.
 LIAM: Okay, so I'll start asking questions to get us there.
 MATT: Easily enough. You eventually are led to it, and you come to a closet that's affixed to another building. The wood used are almost driftwood and heavily weathered, and the front door is closed as you approach. It looks like a glorified storage shed that has been bolted and put up against another structure.
 LIAM: All right, well I will walk up to the door and knock on it.
 MATT: Okay. (knocks) No response.
 LIAM: Is there any breaks in the door or the building or cracks that Frumpkin could fit into?
 MATT: Visual glance, there look like there's the space underneath the door. Probably not big enough for a cat to slip into.
 LIAM: Are there any windows or anything or is it all a big, dirty, dingy mess?
 MATT: There are windows, but if you look at the back of the windows all you see is scraps of material, stacks of books, piles of boxes and crates, it's literally blocked out with things stacked up against it from the interior.
 LIAM: How busy is the front of this place?
 MATT: Not busy at all, it's just the two of you, right now, standing at the front door.
 LIAM: No one's around us, though?
 MATT: It's not on the main street, it's a little pushed back, recessed about ten or 15 feet from the main road so there's no one immediately around you. But there are people walking back and forth on the road behind but you're out in the open, per se.
 SAM: And no one's coming to the door?
 MATT: No one's come to the door yet, no.
 SAM: Want me to break in?
 LIAM: Yes. No.
 MATT: Okay. A moment passes and you hear, "Hold on!" The door opens. It was open. There's the sound of heavy sacks go tumbling down to the interior of it and you glance around and you hear a voice go, "Can I help you?"
 LIAM: Hello?
 MATT: You look down, and there's this crotchety-looking scrawny old gnome who's sitting there in the doorway. He's got this vibrant puff, like a cotton ball, of hair around his head. But it's this perfect “U” of bald on top. No glasses, eyes are very small and beady, and he has this bulbous, round nose at the front with this little bit of a tuft of chin white hair that matches the cotton ball tuft on the sides. He's sitting there clutching the top of the knob on the inside which is actually affixed shorter on the door and he goes, "Well come in."
 LIAM: Yes please, you're open for business I take it.
 MATT: "Always open, come on in."
 LIAM: All right.
 MATT: Turns around and musters his way inside. As soon as you step in the door and look around, this place looks like an episode of Hoarders. It is just floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall, stacks of anything and everything: knick-knacks, small stuffed animals, toys, books, glasses, and goblets. It is the biggest, crammed flea-market into a small shed-like space you've seen.
 SAM: I start unscrewing my flask.
 (laughing)
 LIAM: Frumpkin climbs back up onto Nott's shoulder and nestles in.
 MATT: (meowing)
 LIAM: I am scouting the city for books, I am starved for books.
 MATT: "Well we've got books here."
 LIAM: Yes sir, I'm sorry what is your name?
 MATT: "Oglen. Oglen Hornsblower."
 LIAM: Oglen Hornsblower.
 MATT: "And welcome to my collection. You want to buy something, let me know."
 LIAM: Well I see you sell a great many things in here, books included. This is just things you've collected throughout your lifetime?
 MATT: "Right. Boughten, traded for, found."
 LIAM: I don't know what you just said, but I am interested in books. Particularly in the arcane realm, but any kind of book. Do you have anything that you just outright know is out of the ordinary?
 MATT: "I'm sure we've got a few. Look around! See what you find. It's half the fun, half the journey."
 LIAM: All right, friend, let's-- It's like Winter's Crest morning for me and I'm scanning the shelves.
 MATT: Make an investigation check.
 SAM: Can you give me something to look for? To distract me and give me a mission to go on, please?
 LIAM: Yes. You want to find some sort of tool that helps you do what you do best.
 SAM: All right.
 LIAM: Investigation check, that is a 21.
 MATT: 21?
 SAM: I rolled a 21 investigation check.
 MATT: All right.
 SAM: I'm just looking for baubles to steal.
 (laughter)
 MATT: All right. In thumbing through, there are plenty of books that, within a first glance this is not interesting to you. You have to move things out of the way and push things aside. The smell in there is dusty and moldy and you do find there is some subtle water damage and some mildew growing in one far corner and you're like ugh, put that back. However, you rolled really high. Two things catch your eye. One, there appears to be the remnants of some sort of notebook, a sketchbook that is written in a language you do not understand-- What languages do you know?
 LIAM: Well, off the bat, I don't know where that is in DandD Beyond yet. But if I open up my binder I bet I have a paper version that I can verify with. I speak Sylvan, Common, and Celestial and I also can Comprehend Languages as a ritual spell but I think that takes some time.
 MATT: It does take ten minutes.
 LIAM: Ten minutes.
 MATT: But you glance through the book, and while you cannot read the text you do recognize that there are elements at the back of the book that have a hint of arcane nature. That's one of two books you find with that roll.
 SAM: It's like the adult section for him.
 MATT: I know. The second book you find is written in Zemnian, which you can read.
 LIAM: That's correct.
 MATT: The title translates to Fiends of Folklore.
 LIAM: I'm so happy. You have quite a shop here.
 MATT: "I know I do!"
 LIAM: You have some real treasures. I'm particularly interested in both of these books.
 MATT: "Good choices."
 LIAM: I don't know though, I don't think that-- I mean I'm rather tight on coin at the moment so--
 MATT: "That's too bad."
 LIAM: Maybe my eyes are too big for my stomach.
 MATT: He's pulling the books away from you.
 LIAM: How much would you part with these for?
 MATT: (sniffs) He holds of the Fiends of Folklore book, "Three gold pieces. This one, (sniffs) ten gold pieces."
 LIAM: Which one is which?
 MATT: The Fiends of Folklore is the three, the other tome.
 LIAM: The arcane, weird one.
 MATT: You're not quite sure what's in it.
 LIAM: Okay. Would you have any interest in a magic cat?
 MATT: "I'm sorry?"
 LIAM: Frumpkin disappears from on Nott's shoulder. Reappears next to the little man.
 MATT: (yelps) He like throws the books and grabs nearby this large sack and starts angrily beating the cat.
 LIAM: I'll take that as a no!
 MATT: He does hit Frumpkin. Frumpkin takes one point of bludgeoning damage.
 LIAM: That might be it, I don't really know. I didn't think that this would happen so quickly.
 LAURA: Frumpkin point two.
 MARISHA: Yeah, he updates overnight as long as he's plugged in, right?
 LIAM: Hold on, I have to see if Frumpkin is still here.
 TRAVIS: Must be plugged in and connected to Wifi.
 MARISHA: Type in your passcode if you agree to the terms.
 LIAM: One hit point of damage?
 MATT: Yes.
 LIAM: He's still here.
 MATT: There you go. Frumpkin immediately darts off jumps on your shoulder, turns around and (hisses).
 LIAM: So you don't like cats, I understand that.
 MATT: "Sorry, it caught me off-guard."
 LIAM: Well I was trying to sample the merchandise for you. Because if it was just a cat it was just a cat, but this one-- changes to my other shoulder-- he's a magic cat.
 MATT: "Okay."
 LIAM: You can roll him in mud, he comes back clean. He disappears, he reappears, he brings you things.
 MATT: "Can you make him go away?"
 LIAM: Gone.
 MATT: "Thank you. Now we can continue to talk money."
 LIAM: Here’s what I propose. I do not have ten gold at the moment. But it doesn’t feel like you get a lot of thoroughfare here, so I’m going to come back to purchase this later. That’s it. That’s the end of my spiel; that’s all I’ve got. I’m interested, and thank you for giving me the time.
 MATT: “Of course. Sorry about your cat, friend.”
 LIAM: It’s okay. Nott?
 SAM: Have I heard all of this conversation?
 MATT: You’ve been hearing all of it, but you’ve also found, amongst the chaos, a brass baby bottle that’s fairly dented, but it’s very shiny and polished, you can already see on the inside. You find a new flask, actually. It’s very tarnished, but you spit and rub it a little bit. It looks to be of very fine metallic material. You’re not entirely sure, you’d have to clean it, but it looks like very nice quality material.
 SAM: All right. I’ll try to trade my flask with that flask.
 MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.
 SAM: 22!
 TALIESIN: How?!
 SAM: Wait. More. No, that’s right. 22.
 MATT: Now, your flask, which still has liquor in it, is left behind for the empty flask you receive. However, without an instance of anyone even paying attention. It is yours. You can write in your inventory you are now the owner of a platinum flask.
 ALL: Ooh!
 SAM: Shit! Okay! It’s a baby bottle, or maybe a rattle? What’d you say?
 MATT: Baby bottle. Looks like it was used as a bottle for a very upper-class family.
 TALIESIN: You’re already so ahead, though!
 SAM: I know. But I can’t resist. I’ll try to take one more look and pocket that as well.
 MATT: Make another sleight of hand check, please.
 SAM: 20.
 MATT: It just vanishes into your cloak! It’s the craziest thing! It was there and it’s gone!
 TRAVIS: Yes!
 SAM: Are we going to leave now? Should we leave? I think we should leave. Maybe we should go. Do you need some money? I could lend you some money, if you want.
 LIAM: Maybe we’ll come back tomorrow.
 SAM: All right. Lovely place you got here!
 LIAM: Piggyback?
 SAM: Yes, please!
 MATT: “I’ll hold these books for you! Come back when you can!”
 LIAM: Within the week, I promise.
 MATT: “All right. Have a good day, little girl!”
 SAM: I will!
 MATT: You guys exit the building.
 SAM: I’m sorry! I did it again, I couldn’t help it. I took some things. Do you think he noticed? Do you think we’re in trouble? Maybe we should hurry back.
 LIAM: I don’t think he saw.
 SAM: All right. Are you cross with me?
 LIAM: No. Just wait one moment, okay? Wait for me here?
 SAM: Okay. I heard you talking about money, by the way, I could lend you some, if you’d like.
 LIAM: Wait right here. I cast Detect Magic just before I walk back into the store. I look all around. What are your hours, here? As I look to see if there is anything besides that book, anything.
 MATT: You glance throughout the interior, and you don’t sense anything magical, unfortunately, within the piles of rubble.
 LIAM: Besides the book he put down?
 MATT: The book’s not radiating any magical aura. But he answers. “Oh! All hours! I don’t really close. I don’t really sleep.”
 LIAM: Middle of the night, even?
 MATT: “Sure!”
 LIAM: All right. Business is business. Thank you!
 MATT: “No worries. See you then!”
 LIAM: Bis später.
 MATT: “Bee shimter!”
 LIAM: That guy does not speak Zemnian!
 MATT: No, he does not.
 LIAM: Let’s go back to the hotel, shall we?
 SAM: Let’s do it.
 MATT: While they’re away, you guys wait there for a bit, getting stir crazy in the process of waiting in your room. Jester and Beauregard, there’s a knock at your door.
 LAURA: Hello?
 MATT: “Please open, it’s Crownsguard.”
 LAURA: Hold on, I’m naked! Yeah, I don’t know. Do you want to put clothes on? Should we take our clothes off?
 MARISHA: Did you say that because you wanted to tell me something?
 LAURA: No, I just wanted to make them wait. Okay, I’m dressed now!
 MARISHA: I like that. We’re giving them-- authority. Got the upper hand. Okay.
 LAURA: It’s a power play.
 MARISHA: Do we invite them in or are we going to--? You open the door. I’m going to sit, unassuming, on the bed.
 LAURA: Sit! Come in, please.
 MARISHA: Oh!
 MATT: The door opens, and there are two crownsguards there, standing, shields to the side.
 LAURA: Oh hello, I wasn’t expecting you.
 MARISHA: Oh, yeah, hi.
 MATT: “We’re here to notify you that the investigation is ongoing. You will not be needed today. Please remain in your premises. Be back tomorrow.”
 TRAVIS: Jury summon.
 MARISHA: Bullshit! Jury duty shit! Goddamn it!
 TALIESIN: We are at DandD Jury Duty.
 MATT: Yes you are.
 MARISHA: Seven dollars a day? What is this shit?
 LAURA: Can I ask you a question before you leave?
 MATT: “Yes, what is your question?”
 LAURA: Are you guys going to be the same people coming back tomorrow?
 MATT: “Possibly.”
 LAURA: What is your names?
 MATT: They look at each other, look back at you. “I am Jonas.” The other guy pipes up, he’s a little younger, he goes, “I am Lucas.”
 LAURA: Jonas and Lucas, very good names. 
 MARISHA: You guys should start a band. Like a boy band or something.
 LAURA: Yeah, that’d be good. Girls would go crazy. If you guys want to play some games tomorrow, we’ll just be here!
 MATT: “Very well! Have a good day.” They look at each other like, “What?” and close the door.
 LAURA: I shouldn’t have offered the game. What if we want to leave and then they want to take us up on the game thing?
 MARISHA: I thought you enjoyed games.
 LAURA: No, I love games!
 MARISHA: Sure.
 LAURA: But what if we leave and then they want to *play* games?
 MARISHA: Okay.
 MATT: Onto Fjord’s door.
 TALIESIN: I’m sitting playing with the cards.
 TRAVIS: I open it.
 MATT: Same two guards there. Lucas and Jonas. Jonas and Lucas. “Hello. The investigation is ongoing. You’ll not be needed for today. We will return tomorrow.”
 TRAVIS: I shut the door.
 TALIESIN: Any progress?
 MATT: There’s a pause and then you here the subtle shifting of greaves against the wooden floor as they slowly walk away.
 TRAVIS: Go take that game in the other room, why don’t you?
 TALIESIN: That was a power move right there.
 TRAVIS: Thank you.
 MATT: You guys return to the inn.
 SAM: I guess we do.
 MATT: Yes you do.
 SAM: Well. That was terrible. No one found out anything. It was a waste of a day. We’re all terrible at this. Goodnight?
 LAURA: What time is it?
 MARISHA: That’s not true! I still say that some of the best information that you can get can be in the information that you don’t find.
 SAM: That is nonsense.
 MARISHA: I’m just saying! Sometimes the lack of information can be a process of elimination.
 TRAVIS: Sure.
 MARISHA: It’s super broad!
 TALIESIN: No, you know what? I’m going to take it.
 MARISHA: I’m trying to be fucking silver lining, so I don’t feel like a piece of shit for waste a day, and you guys are shitting on that, but it’s fine.
 TRAVIS: You found nothing at the docks, zip, zero?
 LIAM: We spent hours there, no one knew anything about the old man.
 MARISHA: See? No one knew anything about him. That means, prime candidate, someone’s little experiment. Little Frankenstein. I’m telling you.
 LIAM: I don’t really understand what she’s saying.
 LAURA: I don’t either. I’m going to run up and down the stairs for a while.
 MATT: (quick footsteps)
 TALIESIN: How long have you known this one?
 MARISHA: Who are you talking to?
 TALIESIN: Anybody who’s watching this happen.
 MARISHA: About 24 hours longer than you have.
 TALIESIN: That explains a lot.
 MATT: At one point, Adelaine the barmaid comes up. “I’m sorry, can you *please* stop?”
 LAURA: Okay.
 MATT: “Thank you!”
 SAM: Hey, Dungeon Master?
 MATT: Yes?
 SAM: The other night, when Nott was out carousing a bit while Caleb was asleep. He saw some figures in cloaks dash by. Was there any distinctive anything about these three figures that dashed by?
 MATT: Not that you noticed, unfortunately.
 SAM: Damn it. Okay, I will share that information with the group. I saw some weirdos running around.
 LAURA: When?
 SAM: The other night, when he was asleep.
 TRAVIS: How late?
 SAM: Two in the morning?
 LIAM: You were out that late?
 SAM: Sorry.
 LAURA: Maybe we should go out at two o’clock in the morning and see if we can find them.
 MARISHA: Ooh, that’s a good idea.
 LAURA: Follow them.
 MARISHA: You guys notice that it's weird that no one's actually really talking about this? This is a small town. I come from a small town. Small town people gossip.
 TALIESIN: I feel like there should be some more gossip then there is, that's very true.
 MARISHA: Someone is talking about this, we just haven't found them yet. 2:00AM field trip! 
 LAURA: We can always leave through the window this time.
 MARISHA: Mm-hmm, I like that.
 TRAVIS: I can be down for that.
 TALIESIN: I leave the rope tied in here. Can we use your cat? Reel it back up in so that there's no trace of us until we need to get back there.
 LIAM: Are you asking for my cat to haul up our rope? 
 TALIESIN: No, I'm telling you that your cat is going to haul up a rope.
 LAURA: How is a cat going to lift up a rope?
 TALIESIN: It's not that heavy of a rope, it’s just hemp.
 MATT: Hemp rope can be pretty heavy.
 TALIESIN: Well, if I throw it back up there then I imagine you cat can knock it back down at the very least.
 LAURA: There, that would work, maybe. 
 MARISHA: Oh, is he like an asshole cat? 
 TALIESIN: I assume he's an asshole cat. Aren't all cats asshole cats?
 MATT: This is true.
 LAURA: It might be down before we come back, is the thing.
 TALIESIN: I assume he's going to-- that's fair.
 TRAVIS: Where were you when you saw these cloaked figures?
 SAM: I had gone out to do some window shopping.
 TRAVIS: At 2:00AM? 
 SAM: Yes, I wasn't very successful. I had walked by the general store--
 LAURA: Oh, we went there.
 MARISHA: Yeah, we did.
 SAM: I passed by a place called Natural Remedies, herbs and medicinal things. I went by a spot named Jackalwere, it’s a smithy. 
 LAURA: Okay, but where did you see the cloaked guys?
 SAM: It was between-- I don't remember.
 MATT: It was one block north of the Natural Remedies.
 MARISHA: Natural Remedies. What was the other one? Jackalwere? 
 SAM: I think that was what it was called.
 MATT: Yeah, Jackalwere Smiths.
 SAM: We could do a little stakeout!
 TRAVIS: We could.
 MARISHA: That's true. How do people send messages in this town? Have we figured that out?
 SAM: Probably by foot or by horse, right?
 TALIESIN: Not that big of a town.
 TRAVIS: Should someone stay up? Well, I was thinking someone should keep a lookout on the roof of the inn in case someone comes for us while everyone else is out. 
 LAURA: How would we let anybody know? 
 TRAVIS: I don't know. Can you conjure those golden orbs up into the air as like a signal? 
 LIAM: It's pretty limited. They don't go that far.
 TRAVIS: Maybe we just risk it. 
 SAM: Yeah! 
 LAURA: Let's risk it. 
 TRAVIS: It's 2:00AM, I'm sure everybody will be asleep. Let's risk it. 
 MARISHA: Before we leave-- is there a window in the hall? Or are there only windows in our bedrooms?
 MATT: There is no window in the hall, only in the rooms.
 MARISHA: Okay, that's fine. On our side of the room--
 MATT: You have three rooms between you.
 TALIESIN: There's three rooms and they all have windows.
 MATT: Correct.
 MARISHA: On our side of the door, I'm going to take out my healer's kit. Do I have any bandages or medical tape or anything like that?
 MATT: Not medical tape, but there are clean strips of cloth and some adhesive bandages, basic general--
 MARISHA: I'm going to tie a bandage ever so lightly around one side of the handle onto something on to the other side of the door. If there's something like a lamp or some kind of pipe or something I can tie it to.
 LAURA: So that we'll know if someone tried to come in the room? 
 MARISHA: Correct. 
 LAURA: Okay.
 MATT: You can pull one bandage out and affix to one of the chair legs nearby. You could do that. 
 TALIESIN: Oh for god's sake. I pull out a big thing of string. 
 MARISHA: Okay, yeah. I'll take some string and just some twine and--
 LAURA: What are we going to do? Leave through our window? 
 MARISHA: Yeah. 
 LAURA: To their window? 
 MARISHA: Well, I figured we're all in the same room at this point. 
 LIAM: What are you trying to do?
 MARISHA: I'm trying to make sure that if someone tries to come in our room we'll know if they come in.
 LIAM: I can take care of that. 
 TALIESIN: Oh, well then, I'm taking my string back.
 MARISHA: What can you do? 
 LIAM: I have some magic for that. 
 SAM: Yeah, he has a magical spell that alerts you when someone tries to break in your room.
 LIAM: That is correct. Yeah. I will take a moment to do that and it will let me know.
 SAM: Best part is, it doesn't alert him when I sneak in or out.
 LIAM: That you know of.
 SAM: Wait. What?
 LIAM: One mile of the warded area.
 SAM: Ooh!
 MARISHA: That's better! Let's do that.
 LIAM: I just need ten minutes. And I pull out a little spool of silvered thread and stretch it out. Where did you want this? Over the window?
 MARISHA: Well, I was going to say in the door, but if there's maybe a place in the hall.
 LIAM: Well, I can do the entire room really, I can go doorknob to-- The funny thing about this thread, there's no end to it. So I start looping it all the way around the room and tie it off, and take out one of my books from the holster, the one on the left side, and I open it up. You guys watch as I spend ten minutes referring to the book and tracing symbols on the floor. Along, underneath the thread, and about ten minutes of time, nothing happens, but that's taken care of.
 LAURA: Nice.
 SAM: See, he's really good.
 LAURA: Yeah..
 TRAVIS: Didn't really look like much.
 LIAM: Yeah, either that or I'm really bullshitting you and nothing happened.
 LAURA: Either way, I liked it. Let's sneak out.
 TALIESIN: I'm going to do one last thing before we leave, which is just tussle the room a bit so it looks like it's been robbed. Just in case they do come in.
 MATT: Okay, so you toss the room a bit, muddle up the space, and you guys, one by one, climb out the back of the window, down the rope, and into the alley behind the inn. Looking about, you're waiting until about post-midnight, you said?
 TRAVIS: Yeah.
 MATT: Okay, so it's dark. The various lanterns that dangle on the hook poles at different intersections of the street are lit. Other than that, you have a faint bit of moonlight that's coming through the sky. There are some clouds, but they're a bit broken up, so every now and then the moon cover can vanish and then return, but for now you have moonlight in the city. Where are you guys going?
 LAURA: Towards the north end.
 TRAVIS: I ought to be leading the way, I reckon.
 SAM: Yeah, I'll go to where I saw the three cloaked figures.
 MATT: A little ways north of Natural Remedies? Okay. I would like everybody to make a stealth check, please.
 SAM: Stealth check. Do I still have the blessing? No, I don't.
 LAURA: No, you don't. But I can do it to everybody, one by one, if we get to an open area.
 SAM: 21.
 TRAVIS: 15. 
 MARISHA: 19.
 TALIESIN: 17.
 LAURA: 21.
 LIAM: 40. 12.
 SAM: 42.
 MATT: You guys, following Nott, dodge between alleys, there are a few patrols of the crownsguard that you see passing by, and you wait for them to just cross paths, and then move on. Eventually finding your way to Natural Remedies, seemingly unseen. It's quiet, you can hear the sound of crickets in the distance. The cold night air is causing your breath to show every time you exhale, you all bundle your cloaks as you move on. The moonlight fades a bit, things get darker, but you follow Nott's lead, travel from place to place. You finally get to the outskirts of Natural Remedies, and to the northern alleyway where you'd originally seen those figures pass. You're there.
 SAM: Should we fan out a bit? Cover a couple corners, so we can still see each other?
 TRAVIS: Good idea.
 LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to go with Fjord.
 SAM: Are you two like an item?
 LAURA: What?
 SAM: You and Fjord, are you like a thing?
 LAURA: Why, are you interested in him?
 SAM: No, ugh, no!
 LAURA: No?
 SAM: You travel together.
 LAURA: Well yeah, he's a good friend. He watches out for me, I watch out for him, you know. We're a good team. Like you and Caleb.
 SAM: Not at all like that, but yes, all right.
 MATT: As you guys fan out a little bit, everyone make a perception check.
 LAURA: Natural one.
 SAM: 19.
 LAURA: I don't see shit.
 MARISHA: Perception?
 TALIESIN: 12.
 TRAVIS: Nine.
 MARISHA: 18.
 LIAM: Ten.
 MATT: Okay, so all of you, except for Jester, manage to get a clear view of your vicinity. Jester, you somehow get an eyelash caught in your eye and spend the next hour trying to get it out, but it's in the eyelid.
 LAURA: Can you see it?
 TRAVIS: Look up. Yeah.
 MARISHA: To the left.
 TRAVIS: Let me get it--
 LAURA: No, no, no. Okay, okay, okay.
 MATT: Occasionally, you can hear the crownsguard approaching, and they carry their torches with them. You can see the light crawling forward, so you all duck out of the way and let them pass. About an hour passes. Two hours pass. Around the third hour, you get the sensation that whatever you saw the other night is not arriving on a clockwork time or not arriving at all. It’s about three in the morning, in the center of the city by yourself. What do you wish to do?
 MARISHA: Three in the morning?
 
MATT: Yeah.
 MARISHA: I turn to Caleb. Any tingling from your alarm system?
 LIAM: No, I wouldn’t have brought it up if something had happened.
 MARISHA: That’s a good point. 
 TALIESIN: I’m just going to try to meditate on the strange death and see if I can feel anything. 
 MATT: Okay. Make an intelligence check.
 TALIESIN: All right. 17.
 MATT: Pouring over the details of what has transpired and what you guys have done so far to find information, there are still things to inquire about. There are still things to wonder and discover and there are a few places you haven’t been to. A few places you haven’t returned to. A few people you haven’t even inquired about closer to the investigation.
 LAURA: Oh, we should talk to the girl.
 
SAM: Toya?
 LAURA: Yeah.
 SAM: Let’s go wake her ass up.
 MARISHA: Is she under arrest? We don’t know. 
 TALIESIN: Maybe we have to go back to the circus.
 LAURA: Maybe it was Yasha.
 TALIESIN: It’s early enough maybe we should just--
 TRAVIS: We have a few more hours and the cover of darkness.
 SAM: Yeah, go wake her ass up. 
 MARISHA: Maybe we should go back to the circus. Scene of the crime? That whole thing? 
 TALIESIN: I hate to admit it, but maybe-- it’s not us.
 TRAVIS: Who’s *real* stealthy?
 MARISHA: I’m all right. 
 TRAVIS: Maybe we don’t *all* need to go. Maybe just a few, and the others will hang back.
 SAM: Hang back close by though, right? If something goes bad--
 MARISHA: Or if you see something. How far are we from the inn? 
 MATT: From the inn? About a 15 minute jog.
 SAM: So we can go to the circus? 
 TRAVIS: An hour and a half. 
 LAURA: While we’re still trying to figure this out, I’m going to pull out my painter’s kit and draw like a little piece of poop on the side of the building that we’re next to
SAM: Tagging? That’s good.
 MARISHA: A little tagger.
 TRAVIS: Is it like a mound of poop or like a single--?
 LAURA: No it’s like a mound of poop.
 TALIESIN: It’s like an emoji.
 MATT: Make a performance check.
 LAURA: Oh I rolled really low on this one. Four!
 MATT: It takes a little convincing to have them see the poop in the drawing. You can see it, but you’ve seen better.
 TRAVIS: Is it a worm? It’s a snake.
 LIAM: That’s an *oval*.
 LAURA: I should have drawn a *pile* of poop. I draw a pile of poop next to it.
 
MATT: It helps, but--
 LIAM: That’s a triangle.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, I thought it was like chocolate frozen yogurt.
 
TALIESIN: Is math or something? 
 LAURA: It’s dark okay?! I can usually paint much better than this. It’s really dark and my hand feels a little numb.
 SAM: Let’s move then.
 MATT: Who’s going where? What are you guys doing? 
 
ALL: We’re all going to the circus.
 TRAVIS: *Stealthily* to the circus.
 MATT: All right, I would like for all of you to roll a stealth check.
 MARISHA: Is no one staying behind or--?
 LAURA: Fuck it!
 SAM: Some are staying *away* from the tent.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, going in danger close.
 SAM: 13.
 TRAVIS: Nine.
 MARISHA: Oh not great. Nine!
 TALIESIN: Seven.
 LAURA: 19.
 LIAM: 15.
 SAM: 13.
 MATT: Okay, you guys make your way through most of the Docksward on your way to the large blue tent that still stands ominously in the distance. Thankfully, the moon has come out and cast this rimlight against the structure, so it’s easy to see. As you guys are making your way outside of the Lochward, you immediately see the approaching torchlight of crownsguard. One of them you just faintly hear 40 or 50 feet ahead of you, “Who goes there?”
 LAURA: Oh shit.
 SAM: Is there only one guard? 
 MATT: It’s two guards, side by side. They watch as they patrol in pairs. 
 MARISHA: Are we in like an alleyway, or in the street?
 MATT: You guys are keeping off to the side. You’re all on the outskirts of the lake and almost made your way out of the city towards where the--
 LAURA: Go in the lake. Quick, go into the lake!
 TRAVIS: I cast Disguise Self, and I turn myself into a crownsguard.
 LIAM: Disguise Self and follow suit. 
 MATT: You do as well?
 LIAM: Yeah.
 MATT: All right. So you both become crownsguard. You’ve all of a sudden are adorned in the goldish brass and red armor.
 TALIESIN: I’m in my black hood. I’ve got my hood up now. 
 SAM: Anywhere to hide?
 MATT: There are some small alcoves, but you guys are out in the open, now. They’ve seen you.
 MARISHA: *All* of us? 
 MATT: You don’t know. They’ve seen *you*. They’ve called *to* you, and then both of you guys disguised yourselves. What are you doing?
 LAURA: I walk into the lake and crouch down?
 MATT: Jester walks up and wades in about six inches of water and just-- gives her best duck impression.
 
SAM: I will take off my mask and start attacking Caleb in a convincing fashion. Not to draw blood but-- yeah.
 MATT: Make a deception check. 
 SAM: Deception check? 
 MATT: Yes. 
 SAM: Oh.
 LIAM: Can I start going (groans) Oh get off, you little beast! To help with the illusion?
 SAM: (snarling noises)
 MATT: Sure, make a deception check.
 SAM: Oh, my deception check was a three minus three.
 LIAM: But roll with advantage.
 
SAM: At advantage? 
 LIAM: I’m helping you, you little-- 
 SAM: Seven minus three!
 LIAM: Oh no!
 MATT: Okay so as soon as these two crownsguard see this, they go “Shit!” They pull their blades and they start charging you, Nott to try and protect their other crownsguard--
 LIAM: I take Nott and slam her into a wall as hard as I can and say: Down you beast! 
 MATT: All right, as you rush up in a jog, blades drawn, one of them is going to go ahead and attempt to strike.
 SAM: Oh god! Sure.
 MATT: That is going to be a 14 to hit.
 SAM: Miss! 
 MATT: So you manage to (squeaks) and narrowly dodge the blade as it strikes through the back of your cloak and pins it to the side of a wooden pole that is on the outside of an overhang where some of the fish are being left out to dry and turn into fish jerky. It holds you in place as you’re snarling and looking scared. The other one pulls out his blade and says “Where did this thing come from!?” 
 LIAM: I have it! And I punch Nott right in the face. 
 SAM: Oh!
 MATT: All right, you take one point of bludgeoning damage, Nott, and blood just (flowing noise) from the nose.
 LIAM: I have this we’re taking these people across to jail.
 TRAVIS: (Regal voice) Indeed, stay our blade, please, obviously he can handle this.
 LIAM: Don’t you fucking move you little green piece of filth.
 SAM: (spits)
 TRAVIS: Right in your face! Haha, incredible.
 LIAM: This one is mine, thank you. Beat her within an inch of her life.
 MATT: I need you to make a deception check on that one. 
 TALIESIN: We are just the worst. This is just terrible.
 MARISHA: Oh man.
 LIAM: Natural 20.
 (cheering)
 SAM: We’ve practiced this before. We got this routine down.
 MATT: You see a look of disappointment come across the two crownsguards’ faces in their inability to help you skewer this small, feral creature. They both put their blades away. “All right if you see anything else, give a shout. (spits)”
 SAM: Ugh.
 MATT: They both continue their walk past the rest of you.
 LIAM: The rest of you lot fall in line. I drag the little one off.
 SAM: (snivels)
 MATT: They look over at the tiefling-- partially crouched in the water.
 SAM: She’s taking a shit.
 
LAURA: I really had to pee!
 MATT: “Hey! Not in the Ustaloch!”
 (laughter)
 LAURA: Okay. Oh okay. I get out. I stand up and slowly dredge out of the water.
 MATT: Your legs are soaked from thigh to foot, and they both eye you warily and slowly walk past.
 LAURA: (sigh of relief)
 MARISHA: It’s real cold out.
 LIAM: Have they cleared the way? 
 MATT: Eventually, they pass beyond a point where you feel absolute dread of their presence.
 TRAVIS: Is that a natural thing for you guys to just attack each other in moments of stress? 
 LIAM: Are you all right? I am so very sorry, I’m so sorry--
 SAM: No, I’m fine that was good acting. You were perfect. I panicked, I didn’t know what to do. I was trying to create some sort of distraction.
 LIAM: Let me see your teeth. Okay. You look all right.
 SAM: They’re all over the place.
 (laughter)
 TRAVIS: Oh, I can’t tell if that got worse or better.
 MARISHA: You fixed them a bit!
 LIAM: Okay. Who wants to go to the circus? 
 MARISHA: Yay.
 MATT: All right, you guys are make the rest of the path to the outskirts of the circus. You see at the very front flap of it you see a crownsguard who’s like (yawn) sitting there, his arms crossed to the front keeping an eye out, he is doing late-shift. You do see the faint distant flickering glow of firelight from the back side of the circus.
 MARISHA: What is that? Do you guys have like a nightlight?
 TALIESIN: It’s where we camp.
 MATT: Yeah, you saw it earlier, you saw the campfire.
 MARISHA: Oh sure.
 TRAVIS: If you want to make your ways around, I could distract them for a moment, have a conversation with them.
 MARISHA: Do they still look like crownsguard?
 MATT: Yes.
 TRAVIS: For an hour. 
 MARISHA: Okay, yeah.
 LIAM: You you want to go with them? I’ll go with Fjord.
 SAM: Sure, but will you be watching me or no? You don’t have to.
 LIAM: Frumpkin will.
 SAM: All right. I’ll go with you and-- who else is going? Are you stealthy?
 
LAURA: We’ll take care of you. Don’t worry!
 TALIESIN: They’re not going to talk to you without *me*, so I’m coming, too.
 LIAM: I’m a little jittery, do you want to be a front man for a little while? 
 TRAVIS: Sure I got it, yeah.
 LIAM: Okay.
 MATT: All right, so what are the groups here? 
 SAM: The girls and the boys.
 TRAVIS: Caleb and me--
 LAURA: And Molly.
 SAM: And whatever Molly is.
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: I’m fabulous.
 MATT: Molly, who are you going with? 
 TALIESIN: I’m going with the girls, because the circus kids won’t talk to them without me.
 MATT: All right, so the three of you are going forward. What are you doing? I guess I should ask.
 TRAVIS: I walk up to the guard (regal voice) It’s a late night, not much action this evening. See anything unusual?
 MATT: “Eh, nothing yet. Mostly I hate this. Ugh, I just wish this whole fucking circus would just go. I need to sleep. Regular hours.”
 TRAVIS: Yeah I heard, how long are they supposed to be here?
 MATT: “Until they finish this fucking investigation. They keep bugging people for information, but they’re all just clammed up and not saying shit.”
 TRAVIS: At least you’re by the tent, they’ve had us walking the perimeter of the lake the entire time.
 MATT: “It’s bullshit. I wish they would just go ahead and execute them. That carnival master or whatever and get it over with.” 
 TRAVIS: Did they find anything inside, today? Tell me, *something* interesting, please.
 MATT: “They investigated the corpses and found nothing yet. Still in there if you want to take a look at it.”
 TRAVIS: Would you mind if we popped in?
 
MATT: “I mean I suppose so.” Make a deception check.
 MARISHA: Something good?
 TALIESIN: No.
 LAURA: Oh Jesus.
 TRAVIS: Oh! 13.
 MATT: Okay. He thinks a second on it. “Oh I suppose so.”
 
TRAVIS: We’ll be quick, super fast.
 MATT: “Please, get it over with.” He stops you. “If there’s any way to expedite this, if you can pin it on any of them, we can just kill them and take care of them. Let me know.”
 TRAVIS: Let’s go. (as Grog) That worked way better than I thought. Like we should-- I mean-- (as Fjord) should we look around for stuff or what?
 (laughter)
 LIAM: You are very good with voices.
 TRAVIS: Well you know, I do a little mimicry here and there. We should look, come on. Check the grounds. Maybe we can see where the bodies are laying.
 LIAM: Yeah, let’s have a look around.
 MATT: You guys look inside, the tent is dark. There’s no light inside.
 LIAM: I take a rag out of my side satchel and I cast-- what the hell is it called because I’ve only been a wizard for a short time-- one Dancing Light underneath the rags so it’s only dim.
 MATT: All right, so you have this self-made hooded lantern with the hood you have over it.
 LIAM: Yeah.
 MATT: Okay.
 MARISHA: That’s dope. 
 LIAM: What the fuck are we looking for in here? 
 
 MATT: And Nott, you’re going with them? 
 
 SAM: I’m with the girls.
 MATT: Oh sorry, you’re right .
 TRAVS: Where did the bodies fall? Over there, didn’t they? 
 LIAM: That’s right, yeah.
 TRAVIS: Well let’s search the grounds.
 MATT: You make your way inside, the smell is pretty bad. You can smell the flesh beginning to decay.
 TRAVIS: Have they moved the bodies or are the bodies still there? 
 MATT: With a bit of looking, the bodies are still there where they left them. They have not moved, you can see a couple of remnants of notes and sheets that have been crumpled, but the bodies have been left where they are.
 TRAVIS: Can we check the bodies for anything?
 LIAM: Is there anything arcane? From all my studies, does anything here ring any bells? I have a photographic memory.
 MATT: Go and make a religion check.
 LIAM: All right. That is a ten.
 MATT: Unfortunately, you don’t have a lot of research on the undead, or whatever might be the essence of this creature's creation, and the more you look at it, you're like, “This is not my specialty.”
 LIAM: Okay. What about the perimeters of here, where all the people were? There was a swarm of people. I spend five minutes seeing anything was dropped of interest.
 MATT: Make an investigation check, both of you.
 TRAVIS: That's better.
 LIAM: I miss the twins.
 TRAVIS: 16.
 LIAM: Big ten.
 MATT: Glancing about, you can see the track marks of everyone fleeing. You can see the spatters of blood. You can see the place where the transformation occurred. There is a horrible shedding of certain layers of flesh. You can see previously existing layers of flesh and muscle that were shed as whatever this undead thing was fell to the ground. Once again, you make a religion check as well.
 TRAVIS: Okay. Roll high. I did not. Ten.
 MATT: Yeah. This is not your specialty. You have little experience with the undead and this type of magic.
 TRAVIS: We can't spend that long in here. Maybe we just take a bit of it with us. Do you have a pocket?
 LIAM: I have many pockets, of course I have pockets.
 TRAVIS: Like a jar? I have no pockets!
 SAM: You designed a character with no pockets?! Why would you do that?
 TRAVIS: There’s no pockets! All right, but I'll check.
 LIAM: He's just in the Blue Man Group unitard and that's it.
 MARISHA: I'm sure Rob Liefeld just got a nosebleed and he doesn't know why.
 LIAM: So this dead thing is here in front of me?
 MATT: Two of them. There's the main one, the ground zero one, which is where you were putting all your attention, and then there's the woman, who was transformed as part of the first.
 LIAM: I will take my dagger, and I will slice a little bit off of the woman, and it's going to get dark in here and I will snuff out the light and use the rag to roll it up and I'll put the little piece in my pack.
 MATT: With a squishy sound you place it within your pack.
 LIAM: Let's get out of here, I'm going to be sick.
 TRAVIS: Agreed.
 MATT: All right. The four of you, I need you to roll stealth checks, please.
 MARISHA: Not that one. I don't feel good about it. Oh not bad! 21.
 TALIESIN: 17.
 LAURA: 18.
 SAM: 25.
 MATT: Without issue, you guys quickly dart around the side of the tent and make your way right towards the central area where the multitude of tents to this back encampment is placed. There is a single campfire. The embers are burning out. It has not been kept up. You do see two crownsguard who are currently keeping watch. One of them is slumped in a chair across from the fire and is nodding off. The other is doing a basic patrol and looking around. Other than that, you don't hear any sounds, you don't see anybody else. Just the two crownsguard.
 TALIESIN: Which of the tents is currently occupied?
 MATT: There are four main tents. There are two very large ones, one of which generally contains Toya and Kylre, the devil toad. That's on the south side. There's the north largest tent, this one contains the Knot sisters and Ornna. Then there's a very small tent to the south side that would be Bo the Breaker's tent, but he's not here. Then there's a medium sized tent on the north side. Who would be in that one?
 TALIESIN: Toya and Kylre share a tent, that's right. It would be Desmond.
 MATT: Desmond would be the other one. It would be Gustav staying there as well, but Gustav changes between the tent and the cart.
 MARISHA: The cart?
 TALIESIN: We have a wagon.
 LAURA: Molly, I have a question. What made you guys set up your tent here?
 TALIESIN: We were told to set it up here, if I recall. 
 LAURA: In this specific area?
 TALIESIN: That sounds right. If I recall, we were specifically told to set up tent right here.
 MARISHA: And it's by the lake, right?
 MATT: Maybe 150-200 feet away from it.
 MARISHA: That's pretty close to a lake.
 LAURA: What if they set up their tent on a cursed land or something?
 MARISHA: It's the lake, it’s common?
 TALIESIN: What's the easiest tent to get to without--
 MATT: Do you want to go to the north side or the south side of the main tent?
 TALIESIN: I want to go with whatever's furthest away from the guards.
 SAM: Shouldn't we just go to the Toya tent?
 MATT: The Toya tent's on the south side, that’s the opposite side, you guys would have probably come in from the north end.
 TALIESIN: What’s the easiest to get to without--
 MATT: That would be the one that contains Ornna and the Knot sisters. 
 TALIESIN: I'm going to go back there and do our traditional (bird call)
 MATT: Okay. There's actually no response.
 LAURA: (bird call)
 MARISHA: I had Mona and Lena, but maybe it’s Lolie.
 TALIESIN: Yuli. It’s Mona and Yuli. I'm going to try one of the other tents. Am I getting the sense that any of them are in?
 SAM: Look over here!
 TALIESIN: Over here!
 MATT: The other tent you get to and you make the same sound? This would be the one that Desmond usually is in, too. There's a pause, and then you hear a very faint (bird call).
 TALIESIN: I'm going to very gently lift the back of the tent up and not go in through the front. And just--
 MATT: Okay. You glance inside and you can see, leaning up from a bedroll, Desmond who is half-awake, and glances over and sees you. He's out of outfit, out of makeup, and he gives a nod.
 TALIESIN: (whispering) Do you know what's going on? (switches to normal volume) Assume we're whispering, because this is bullshit.
 MATT: Yeah.
 TALIESIN: How is it? What's happened?
 MATT: "They've come around asking a few questions, we're trying to figure it out ourselves. Are you okay?"
 TALIESIN: I could be worse.
 MATT: "How's Gustav? And Bosun?"
 TALIESIN: They couldn't be worse. And then Yasha Yasha'd. I don't know. Did Toya see anything? Did she say anything?
 MATT: "We're still trying to figure this out ourselves. Are you alone?"
 TALIESIN: No, I've picked up a few scragglers. They're idiots, but they're helping.
 MATT: "Well bring them in."
 SAM: We come in.
 MATT: You guys all enter the tent and you see Desmond. Previously you saw him in these very colorful outfit with the frilled neck piece and the full facial makeup. Now you see a man in his late 30s with a very scarred left side of his face. It looks like it was shredded at one point in his youth, that the makeup hid during the performance. As soon as you enter, even upon greeting him, he has a very sad presence to him. Even though you're all under the cover of night and having this conspiratorial conversation, he has this melancholy about him that permeates the space inside the tent. He says, "So you’re all the ones that helped earlier. Thank you. It would have been far worse if you hadn't."
 LAURA: No problem.
 TALIESIN: What do they think happened? What are they asking?
 MATT: "They're thinking something about the show. They're thinking Gustav made this happen. I don't think it's Gustav, he's a good man. He makes poor choices and it's plagued him his whole life, you can see it in his brow. But good intentions have grave consequences. No one that good comes out of Shady Creek Run without some mistakes behind them, but I don't see him doing this."
 TALIESIN: What would be the point?
 LAURA: Has it ever happened like this before?
 MATT: "No."
 LAURA: Anything weird ever happened before?
 MATT: "Weird things? All the time. We're a bunch of weird folk, work with a lot of weird people. Bunch of strange freaks gathered at this show."
 MARISHA: Was there anyone new here recently that you haven't worked with a lot?
 MATT: "Yeah, she apparently ran off."
 TALIESIN: Yasha's the newest, but she can be flighty.
 MARISHA: What about Mona and Yuli?
 MATT: "The sisters are bitter, but it's no fault of theirs."
 MARISHA: Why are they bitter?
 MATT: "Because the world is cruel."
 TALIESIN: You've never met it-- Well, nevermind.
 MATT: "I wish I could help them, but it--"
 MARISHA: (stutters) What happened to them?
 LAURA: Are you drunk? What's going on?
 MARISHA: No, I'm trying to hear and whisper at the same time.
 LAURA: You can talk at a normal volume.
 MATT: Magical whisper. Cone of Whisper.
 MARISHA: Matt Cone of Whisper!
 TALIESIN: Oh God, that's a new thing now.
 MARISHA: What did they say? Why do they think that? Why is the world shitty?
 MATT: "Have you been around? Have you travelled to see anything?"
 MARISHA: Yeah. Listen. The world has its own brand of shitty depending on whose eyes are looking at it, right? So what is their brand of shitty?
 TALIESIN: Circus shitty.
 MATT: "I don't know. Ask them."
 MARISHA: Where are they?
 TALIESIN: In a tent over there.
 MATT: "They don't seem to take much of a liking to me anyway, so I can't really tell you myself. I’m sorry."
 SAM: They don't like you? Why?
 MATT: "There's a lot of people that don't like me."
 LAURA: I like you, Desmond. I think you're great.
 SAM: Why? What did you do?
 MATT: He looks at you and goes, "Same reason folks probably don't like you; you're different."
 SAM: Hmm.
 TALIESIN: Is everybody still here? They've not taken anyone away other than--
 MATT: "Other than those two, everyone else is here. We're just keeping under watch until their investigation is complete."
 MARISHA: Molly, why did you laugh when I asked about the sisters?
 TALIESIN: We're carnival people, we've all got our issues. You don't end up here unless you're a little weird.
 LAURA: Can I try something? I want to try to cast Detect Good and Evil.
 MATT: Okay.
 LIAM: Cleric shit!
 LAURA: Right?
 SAM: On?
 LAURA: On the area. It lasts up to ten minutes, so it's within 30 feet of me.
 TRAVIS: You ever cast this before?
 LAURA: No.
 TRAVIS, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: First cast!
 TRAVIS and TALIESIN: First blood!
 MATT: So you cast it. You concentrate. You reach down and grasp the bottom of your symbol that hangs around your belt, and there's a faint rush of divine force given to your consciousness. You don't sense within 30 feet of you any fiendish, or celestial, or fey, or undead, or aberration.
 LAURA: Nothing that's been desecrated?
 MATT: Nothing from this tent or within 30 feet.
 SAM: Does it follow her?
 LAURA: Yeah, it follows me.
 MATT: It's like a radial thing.
 SAM: That's pretty cool, let's keep going then. Maybe we'll see something?
 LAURA: Yeah. Am I close to the edge of the main tent?
 MATT: There are two tents to the north. There's a bigger one, and a medium one. The one that you're in right now is the larger one to the north, and as such contains-- Actually no. The one that you guys are in right now is the medium one. The one that contains Desmond. The larger one contains both of the sisters and Ornna.
 LAURA: Okay. And they're closer to the big tent? Where is the big tent?
 MATT: Correct. The big tent is about ten to 15 feet from the one you're in right now.
 LAURA: Okay, cool. Yeah, let's leave. I'll get up to the edge of the big tent, and I want to see if I can feel anything weird in that area.
 MATT: Okay. Is everyone else staying inside or are you going with her?
 SAM: We're going with, but before we leave I'll ask Desmond: From one outcast to another, are there any questions that are bugging you about all this?
 MATT: He thinks for a second. "I don't want this all to fall on Gustav. He's done a lot of good for all of us, and the way they're talking about the investigation, they're looking to make a scapegoat of this."
 SAM: Well, thank you.
 MATT: "Thank you."
 SAM: (mimics bird call poorly) That's how they talk to each other. That's how carnival folk talk to each other.
 TALIESIN: Oh, for fuck’s sake. I'm going to do my best.
 MATT: "Thank you."
 TALIESIN: I'm going to quietly sneak out the back of the tent again and sneak into the--
 MATT: Another stealth check, my friends.
 TALIESIN: Oh god, I hate all of this.
 LAURA: I'm going to give Molly Blessing, so you get advantage.
 SAM: 21.
 MARISHA: 13. Not great.
 TALIESIN: 13.
 MATT: With advantage?
 TALIESIN: With advantage.
 LAURA: 12.
 MATT: Okay. You guys make your way up to the edge of the tent.
 TALIESIN: I'm not going to make the noise I'm just going to--
 MATT: Right. As you make your way over to the edge of the tent where the sisters and Ornna are, you focus and concentrate. Nothing, from the radial thing. One of the guards, who's standing up and making a patrol, looks over right as you duck behind and you hear a "Huh?"
 SAM: Uh oh.
 LAURA: Quick, go in the tent.
 TALIESIN: We're going to go in the tent.
 LAURA: We all duck under the tent go and act like I'm sleeping.
 MATT: You guys all dodge under the tent just as the guard begins to pass around. You hear the footsteps around. As you step in you watch as the two Knot sisters--
 TALIESIN: (shushes)
 MATT: They both curl into a ball and stay really quiet. All of the sudden Ornna comes to consciousness and the footsteps finish the circle and then go back towards where the fire is.
 LAURA: That was close.
 MATT: Ornna leans in, goes like, "Okay, what is going on."
 TALIESIN: That's what I'm trying to figure out, what the fuck is going on. They're with me, it's been complicated. Gustav's in deep. Bosun's in deep. 
 LAURA: Tell us you know something.
 MATT: "What do you want to know?"
 TALIESIN: What did you see? I don't know.
 SAM: Who did this? What was it?
 MATT: "I don't know. I looked and I saw what you saw."
 TALIESIN: This is Ornna I assume.
 MATT: This is Ornna, yeah.
 TALIESIN: Ornna is the fire dancer.
 MARISHA: Right, okay.
 TALIESIN: For fuck's sake, they're going to kill every last fucking one of us unless we figure this out.
 MATT: She's like, "Right."
 TALIESIN: What do you think?
 MATT: "Well the sister's over here think it's a hit job, but this isn’t a hit job with zombies? Are you fucking kidding me?
 TALIESIN: I don't know. I think that they're trying to cover something.
 MATT: "That's not surprising."
 MARISHA: Can I insight check the sisters? What are they doing right now?
 MATT: They're both just quietly curled up and watching you guys talk.
 MARISHA: They're not saying anything, though?
 MATT: Not yet. If you want to ask them something you can.
 MARISHA: Do they look nervous or are they just being shifty?
 MATT: Make an insight check to find out.
 MARISHA: Yeah.
 LAURA: While she's doing that I'm going to try and sneak out the underside of the tent to go to the big tent.
 SAM: I'll go with her.
 MATT: This is a bit of a leap. This goes about 25, 30 feet south of where you are around the campfire that's open.
 SAM: No problem.
 MATT: Go ahead and make your stealth checks, guys.
 TALIESIN: Oh god. I miss Pass Without a Trace so much.
 SAM: 23.
 TALIESIN: That's a number.
 LAURA: Nine.
 MATT: Okay. What was your insight check?
 MARISHA: 15.
 MATT: 15. They both look nervous, but just untrusting of the scenario. You can't read anything deeper than that. There is definitely a, hmm, but you can't quite get a full beat on them. You guys, as you curl around the outside, there's the one guard that's sitting in the chair by the fire that goes like (snores) and opens his eyes a little bit and looks over in your direction, Jester, and there's a brief moment where he's just looking right at you. Do you do anything?
 LAURA: I freeze.
 SAM: Oh god.
 MATT: Stands up.
 LAURA: Can I use-- oh shit. I'm going shitballs, shit.
 SAM: I'm just tucking around, getting ready.
 MATT: You're around, you don't see anything.
 SAM: I don't see this?
 MATT: Sorry, he doesn't see you.
 LAURA: I'm going to cast Charm Person on the guard that sees me.
 MATT: Okay. As he stands up, he goes toward you and he goes for his blade and he has to make a saving throw.
 SAM: Oh boy.
 MATT: Which he does not make. I don't think so, it's like a six.
 SAM: No, it's like 13 or something.
 LAURA: Yeah.
 MATT: So he goes like--
 LAURA: Hi, I'm not here.
 MATT: "Okay."
 LAURA: Okay. Sit down. Go to sleep, this is a dream.
 MATT: Make a persuasion check.
 TALIESIN: That's so good.
 LAURA: (That's so close. This is so bad. Five.
 MATT: He doesn't seem to buy the dream thing, but he's like--
 LAURA: You want it to be a dream.
 MATT: He doesn't go to sleep but he knows you're there and he's keeping an eye, but he's not doing anything.
 LAURA: Okay, well it's good enough, I guess.
 MATT: But he's definitely aware that you're there.
 LAURA: I'm going to go towards the big tent just so I can see if I can sense any evil.
 MATT: Okay. Really quickly, just to check because it’s-- That's right, Charm Person is not--
 LAURA: It's not, yes.
 MATT: Okay. It's at this point that you turn your attention to the tent and focus. There is a hefty, radiating warm fiendish source from the inside of that large tent.
 SAM: We found something!
 LAURA: I can sense something. Let’s go in the tent.
 SAM: Go in? But if it’s bad, that’s bad.
 LAURA: What if it’s just a dead thing?
 SAM: Oh god, will we have to fight a dead thing? Should we get some help? I turn to Caleb’s cat and I say go! Go get Caleb! Shoo! (hiss) Go away! (hiss) I can’t speak Cat! Go away!
 MATT: The cat goes, (angry meow).
 SAM: Go away! Go tell Caleb we’re here!
 MATT: (hiss)
 LIAM: Yes!
 MATT: Turns around and sprays you and then keep walking.
 SAM: Okay, I’ve sent for help.
 LAURA: Okay. Let’s go under the tent.
 SAM: All right, let’s go.
 MATT: You guys carefully maneuver under the tent. As soon as you curl into the interior of the tent you hear a very heavy (snoring).
 LAURA: This the big tent that you guys were just in?
 SAM: No.
 MATT: No, it’s the one on the south side of it.
 SAM: It’s a different one.
 LAURA: Oh!
 MARISHA: Toad guy.
 MATT: You see the slowly expanding and contracting form of Kylre from the back side. You see this giant, scaly, somewhat oily exterior of the body.
 SAM: That’s why you detected him, because he’s a fiend.
 LAURA: Maybe he’s a good fiend, can fiends be good?
 SAM: I don’t know, you detected--
 LAURA: Is he still sleeping?
 MATT: (snoring)
 LAURA: He’s still sleeping.
 SAM: We can wake him up and ask?
 LAURA: And ask if he’s good or bad?
 SAM: Yeah?
 LAURA and SAM: Eh.
 SAM: Is anyone else in the tent? 
 MATT: Make a perception check.
 SAM: One.
 LAURA: Oh no, we suck at this.
 LIAM: This? Everything!
 LAURA: 17.
 MATT: Okay, that’s better. You just stare right at the body of this toad going, “Nope.”
 SAM: This looks really big, it’s scary.
 MATT: You glance and see a faint bit of a whitish material from the crook of the arm. You take a few steps forward and glance from the side and you can see asleep, cradled in his large, lizardman arms, Toya, dwarf girl is curled up and asleep peacefully.
 SAM: We should talk to her, but if we wake her up he’s going to be mad. I guess we have no choice, we should talk to her. She’s a dwarf? Do you speak Dwarvish?
 LAURA: No, I don’t.
 SAM: Maybe she speaks Common. We’ll be fine. She’s a circus person.
 LIAM: I have that ability, it lets you know exactly which thing is the fiend. Which of those things is the fiend?
 LAURA: Which of the things is the fiend?
 MATT: It’s the large source. 
 LAURA: It’s definitely the large fiend.
 LIAM: It could have easily been the little girl.
 MATT: It could have been, yeah.
 LAURA: It’s the big guy.
 SAM: Let’s wake her up!
 MATT: The radiance is around the large creature.
 LAURA: And her name is Toya?
 SAM: Toya. Singing dwarf.
 LAURA: Let’s sit down on the ground and look non-threatening. So we sit down cross-legged. Just casual. Like we’re having a tea party.
 SAM: Lift up my hair.
 LAURA: And then we go: Toya! Toya wake up!
 SAM: Wakey wakey!
 MATT: The breathing stops and there’s this stillness in the interior of the tent.
 SAM: We should light a light or something? Otherwise we’re just in the dark.
 MATT: You hear this faint sound of squeaking as lubricated folds of lizardman flesh twist over each other as the devil toad’s head kind of curls back to look at you quietly, the mouth slightly ajar. You can see rows of teeth and this bit of drool down the edge of the chin onto the ground. “What. you. want?”
 LAURA: We’re here to talk to Toya.
 MATT: At which point the little girl (yawn) begins (grunt) (thumping) and rotates in his space. He takes up almost the entirety of this tent. And slowly rotates around inside. Surprisingly quiet for his size. And still clutching Toya, Toya sits up and is like “What’s happening? (yawn)”
 LAURA: Hi!
 MATT: “Hi!”
 SAM: Sorry to disturb your slumber.
 MATT: She takes her braids and holds them with her hands, it’s almost a safety blanket she curls into herself. She looks about 11 or 12. This close you can see she looks younger than she did from that distance. Whether it be the presence or the mature voice. But she seems pretty young. But she’s not childlike.
 LAURA: Oh hey! What’s going on.
 MATT: “ Well?”
 SAM: Do you recognize us from the other night? Last night? 
 LAURA: Last night.
 SAM: Last night?
 MATT: “I don’t remember, I got scared.”
 LAURA: It was scary. You have a really pretty voice.
 MATT: “Thank you.”
 LAURA: Did you notice how when you sang that a dude turned into a zombie?
 MATT: She begins to chuckle. And the big toad (laughter). “I did. It was really scary! I didn’t like it at all. I didn’t do that, did I?” 
 LAURA: Probably not.
 SAM: Has it happened before, or was that--
 MATT: “No. The guards are saying I probably did that, they’re saying I might have done that.” It’s interesting, you notice now listening to her, she has this beautiful voice but her speaking voice is very crackly. It sounds almost damaged.
 LAURA: Do you sing all the time, Toya?
 MATT: “I sing a lot. It’s what keeps me alive, it’s what gets me money.”
 LAURA: Right. I understand that.
 SAM: Was that the same song you always sing?
 MATT: “Yeah. It’s the one song I know.”
 SAM: Did it feel the same coming out of you or was it different?
 MATT: “It felt the same.”
 LAURA: What language is it?
 MATT: “It’s an old dwarven tune. My mother taught it to me before she passed.”
 LAURA: What does it mean?
 MATT: “It’s a tale of the angels and how they came from the realms beyond of the gods. They granted each to us our sparks of life.”
 LAURA: Granted sparks of life. Does that sound like a familiar story that I’ve heard before?
 MATT: It sounds vaguely religious, but--
 SAM: When you were singing, did you hear any other sounds or words that someone else was saying?
 MATT: “No, not beyond the ordinary. Then I saw that poor man just start tearing through people. I got scared and Kylre helped me.” She puts her arm up and pats and (grunt).
 LAURA: How did you and Kylre meet?
 MATT: “They brought me into the circus. I was up in a city north of here, far north of the Marrow Valley and I was just on the streets singing. And this carnival came by and I met Gustav and he invited me to join and that’s how I met Kylre and I met all these wonderful people.”
 SAM: Has anyone new come around and talked to you?
 MATT: “No.”
 SAM: Asked you to do anything? It’s so strange.
 LAURA: Man, we suck at this.
 SAM: No, we’re really good.
 MATT: “The newest people we’ve had are Mollymauk and Yasha.”
 LAURA: They’re new?
 MATT: “Comparatively. Mollymauk’s been here almost two years now.”
 LAURA: Oh. Okay.
 MATT: “He came after I did. We both found our voice together. I was very scared and he wasn’t talking and together we helped each other learn to have fun again.”
 SAM: And yesterday before the show you didn’t notice anything weird, anyone creeping around the carnival, setting up anything?
 MATT: “No.”
 SAM: Snooping around?
 LAURA: Anybody in weird cloaks?
 SAM: Cloaks, cloaks!
 MATT: “I didn’t see anything.”
 
LAURA: Okay.
 LIAM: DM, on a minor note, I put my hand on Fjord’s shoulder and say I’m going to be blind for a second, give me a little slap if anything goes wrong. And I turn into Frumpkin who should still be--
 MATT: At this point in time you notice (laughter) Nott going “Shoo! Cah! Go find help!” and you hear a (hiss) (grumpy meow). Yeah.
 LIAM: And then Frumpkin takes off?
 MATT: Frumpkin starts heading back around towards you.
 LIAM: So I’m looking at myself after a moment.
 MATT: Briefly, as you keep concentrating, Frumpkin finds his way under the tent and comes up to you.
 SAM: Is there anyone you think would want to destroy the carnival or hurt Gustav? Does Gustav have any enemies? 
 MATT: "I hope not. I know him and Ornna argue a lot, but--"
 SAM: Him and Ornna? It's Ornna! Ornna's the one. Thanks very much, we're out of here.
 (laughter)
 SAM: Hot lead!
 LAURA: Let's go! We've got it, we've solved the case!
 TALIESIN: I'm going to have a tiny bit of conversation with her.
 MATT: Yeah. So while they're gone, the two of you are in the other tent with the sisters and Ornna.
 MARISHA: I would like to talk with the sisters while that is going on.
 MATT: They're both sitting there, knees tucked to their chest.
 MARISHA: I go and sit down next to them, putting my knees up, too. This whole thing is really messed up, right?
 MATT: "Yeah, you're telling us."
 MARISHA: Yeah. Man. Like, why would we do anything like that? I feel like we're all being needlessly persecuted.
 MATT: "I'm sorry, who are you?"
 MARISHA: Oh, sorry. I'm Beau. The other Bo, but I helped fight the zombies the other night. I'm under house arrest. We're under the same situation, just separately. Not really. I don't want to compare myself to you, because that would be rude.
 MATT: The two halfling twins look at each other, and back at you.
 TALIESIN: Her name's Beau. She's helping, she's awful, you have a lot in common.
 MATT: "Okay, well, I mean, whatever you want to know."
 MARISHA: He's such a dick. Why is he such a dick?
 MATT: "Molly's great, why are you such a dick?"
 TRAVIS: Reversal!
 MARISHA: Oh, sorry, he's been talking shit about you this whole time, I don't know, I just--
 MATT: Make a deception check on that.
 TRAVIS and LIAM: Oh.
 LIAM: Stirring the pot.
 MARISHA: It's okay. 15.
 TALIESIN: I'm going to walk by the two twins, because I'm circling the tent, trying to get a look, and be like, I've absolutely been talking shit. You're both terrible. I give them both a kiss on the head and keep walking.
 MATT: Okay. They both, "All right, so what are you trying to do?"
 MARISHA: What am I trying to do? I'm trying to figure out who's behind all this so that we can keep moving on with our lives.
 MATT: "All right, well, get it over with. Soon as this is done, we're out."
 TALIESIN: They may not let us leave. They may be killing us all.
 MATT: "They're not going to kill us all!" The other goes, "They're not going to kill us all."
 TALIESIN:They're weird out there. They're very weird out there.
 MATT: (sighs)
 MARISHA: Your guys’ performance was amazing, by the way.
 MATT: "Thanks."
 MARISHA: I loved it.
 SAM: We're stealthing over to that tent, by the way.
 LAURA: I thought we were stealthing over to the main tent.
 SAM: The one with Ornna in it.
 TALIESIN: Ornna's in the tent with us.
 MATT: Oh, you guys are going to the main tent.
 LAURA: I wanted to get to the main tent to see if I could sense any evil in the big, main tent.
 SAM: Oh, you want to swoop by the main tent?
 LAURA: But if it's really far away.
 MATT: Not too far away from where you were, because you're backing out the side of it. So you can go ahead and stealth around. Make a stealth check.
 LAURA: Oh, god. Please no one, please no whammies. 
 TALIESIN and LAURA: Big money.
 SAM: I'm fine.
 LAURA: Natural 20!
 MATT: Nice, and what did you get?
 SAM: 22.
 MATT: The two of you, without issue, make your way around towards the large tent without being seen.
 SAM: Any evil?
 LAURA: I'm sensing it.
 MATT: Nothing.
 SAM: Goddamn it.
 LAURA: No fucking evil!
 SAM: It's Ornna! We know who it is! We know who the killer is!
 TALIESIN: While you're talking to the twins, I'll be talking to Ornna. Oh, for fuck's sake.
 MATT: "To be honest, if it's any easier, it's probably Gustav."
 TALIESIN: It's not fucking Gustav.
 MATT: "It probably is, you shut up. He's a prick, he doesn't know what he's doing, he's going to run this whole carnival into the ground. I don't want to take the fall for it, we all get away on this.”
 MARISHA: No!
 TRAVIS: Little feet.
 LIAM: (snarling noises)
 TRAVIS: Eats and shoots the same way. (snarls)
 MARISHA: So wait, it's probably Gustav? What makes you say that?
 MATT: "Because he's in prison, he's the leader, he's fucked this whole thing by letting this happen."
 MARISHA: Oh. Wow. You have interesting perspectives. Hey, weird question, how do you guys come up with your acts? Is that something that you guys create yourselves, or do you guys workshop it? 
 TALIESIN: It's like she's never experienced boredom. It's very weird.
 MATT: "Yeah. It's impressive."
 TALIESIN: Hey, Ornna?
 MATT: Ornna goes, "Yes?"
 TALIESIN: (sighs) I mean, I know your feelings on all this. What do you think?
 MATT: (sighs) "I'd say Bosun's a stand up guy, if a bit of a self-absorbed dick at times. And we all knew Gustav was going to shit the bed sooner or later, I mean, this is his karma. I just don't know how, or why, but I can guarantee you, if this was my carnival, this shit wouldn't have happened."
 TALIESIN: Really?
 MATT: "Mm-hmm."
 TALIESIN: What exactly would you have done?
 MATT: "Well, first off, I would have made sure that we had better support from the guard before this ever happened so nobody else got killed."
 TALIESIN: They were useless.
 MATT: "Secondly, I would have made sure that there weren't any old folks that made it in to fucking turn into shit."
 TALIESIN: Well, that's on me and-- That's on me.
 MATT: "I don't know."
 MARISHA: You feel the same way, Knot sisters? Feel like this is karma on Gustav?
 TALIESIN: They would.
 MATT: At which point, the flap of the tent opens up and it's Jester.
 LAURA: It's Ornna!
 SAM: Ornna, you have a lot of explaining to do!
 MARISHA: Shut up!
 SAM: We've talked to Toya. She knows it's you who did this!
 LAURA: We know you guys are in a fight all the time.
 SAM: You're the one behind the whole plot! You did it!
 LAURA: You!
 MATT: The two Knot sisters immediately go, "Ornna? Is it you? Did you kill that guy?" Ornna's like, "I don't know what you're talking about. What the fuck is this? Who the fuck are you!"
 LAURA: Why did you turn that guy into a zombie?
 SAM: Who do you work for!
 TALIESIN: Ornna, Ornna.
 MARISHA: Insight check on the Knot sisters!
 MATT: Go for it.
 SAM: They've got Nazi in their name!
 MARISHA: What?!
 SAM: Knot *see*sters
 MARISHA: Natural 20!
 LAURA: The first whisper!
 MARISHA: Give me that sweet whisper!
 SAM: Guys, I don't know about you. But my stats are so neat because of DandD Beyond tonight.
 LIAM: There's no pencil smudges.
 SAM: No, I know right now I've got 14 of 15 hit points.
 TRAVIS: It opens, it closes, you can see your spells when you need to see them without flipping.
 TALIESIN: I've got a little iPad button on the back of my pen, it's quite nice.
 SAM: Start talking, or this gnome-- nope! Goblin! Starts biting.
 MATT: Ornna goes, "To be perfectly honest, I have no idea what's going on. Y'all just came in here, started throwing accusations at me. Gustav got arrested. Boson got arrested. *Molly* got arrested, I'm glad you got off that. But to be perfectly honest, this whole thing's a shit show. And the circus is probably not going to be the same after this."
 LAURA: Insight check on the--
 MATT: Insight check on Ornna.
 LIAM: My cat is on patrol because we've been standing with out dicks in our hands for a long time.
 MATT: Yeah, I'm sorry.
 LIAM: No! I'm not complaining, but I would have sent the cat out.
 LAURA: Seven.
 MATT: Kind of hard to read. She seems genuinely frustrated and caught off guard by this.
 LAURA: I think she's telling the truth.
 TALIESIN: Ornna, you might as well come clean, this is classic you.
 MATT: She looks at you. "Molly."
 TALIESIN: I'm just trying to--
 MATT: "Fuck you."
 TALIESIN: Oh, fuck you, too. It's no secret that Ornna and Gustav have their differences, but this ridiculous. I mean, she knows damn well that half the circus would leave if he got fucking arrested and died.
 MATT: "You're for real worried about this? You really think who it could be? Let's play. Gustav: he's an idiot. But he's not a murderer. Bosun: bit of a dick. But he's a stand up fella. Toya: absolute doll. Couldn't hurt a fly. Mona and Yuli: They're cunts. But they're not going to kill anyone. Desmond's a weird fellow. There's something dark in his past; you can see it in his melancholy. 
 TALIESIN: But this is not his style.
 SAM: It's Desmond. Let's go to his tent!
 TALIESIN: I just grab--
 MATT: "There's some untrustworthy intelligence in those lizard eyes of that devil."
 LAURA: I did get a very evil kind of vibe off him.
 TALIESIN: What do you mean evil kind of vibe?
 LAURA: Well, I mean, he's a fiend.
 TALIESIN: He's what?
 LAURA: The devil toad guy. He's a fiend.
 TALIESIN: That's just a name. It's not actually, like real thing. That just--
 LAURA: You guys know he’s a fiend, right?
 MATT: There’s this moment of silence, like, “He’s supposed to be lizardfolk.”
 TALIESIN: What do you--
 SAM: It’s the lizard man!
 TALIESIN: I grab and push you down into the ground and hold you. (shushing sounds) Not yet.
 MATT: You guys, what are you doing?
 LIAM: I mean, just because we’re standing here so long, I would have been nervous and again held on to this guy’s big bicep and sent the cat out.
 TRAVIS: Why are you going all catatonic on me?
 MATT: (laughs) Nice. As the cat darts under the tent and makes its way through, you glance over to the fire and sees a large dark shape step out from one of the tents and you watch as one of the guards who’s sitting in the chair stands up and crumples onto the ground without a sound. You see the other guard look over, go over to around him and start to check around. You guys hear a voice in the back start saying, “Damon?”
 LIAM: Fjord, something bad is happening.
 MATT: You watch as the dark figure spins and two flashes of red in the shadow nearby and you watch as the other guard suddenly grabs his head and grasps for his chest and falls on his back as his legs curl up.
 MARISHA: What the fuck!
 LIAM: Do I know where in relation to Fjord and I this is?
 MATT: It is to the east of you, about 150 feet.
 TRAVIS: Can you talk to me when you’re looking through the cat?
 LIAM: I can talk, but I can’t hear anything when I’m doing this.
 MATT: Correct. You watch as the shadow bounce like a giant frog--
 LIAM: The frog is on the move. Frog is on the move.
 MATT: --northward.
 LIAM: Away from us? But I don’t know where the eyes are.
 MATT: You guys hear the name calling, and then silence once more.
 LAURA: (whispers) Can we peek outside of the tent and see what’s going on?
 MATT: You guys go ahead and you look just as the guard on the ground is like (gurgling) and just stops moving. You see all the veins bulging. 
 MARISHA: I run up to the guard and check his pulse. Is he still alive or is he paralyzed?
 MATT: As you come out of the tent, you watch as the flesh on his neck and throat splits and a very familiar transformation begins to take place as both of the guards begin to (growling).
 LAURA: Oh no. We have to fight them.
 MARISHA: Yeah, but get under the tent! We can get the drop!
 LIAM: I come out of it and I: Zombies. I start running towards the tent that I saw Jester peek out from under.
 MATT: As you guys rush underneath the big blue tent, you watch as the two that are quickly bulging and mutating, bits of their flesh dislodging from their body and falling. You watch now, up close, similar to the last time, but now that you are looking intently for this, you can see where there should be blood, it’s almost like dust and sand begin to spill from the wounds. Something you had noticed a little bit in the body of the old man before, but you didn’t know if it was decomposition or just general dirt.
 TALIESIN: Girls, we’re not supposed to be here. Can you help us handle this?
 MATT: You watch as the two halflings were like, “Fuck no!” 
 TALIESIN: (sighs) We’ll do what we can. If something goes wrong, nudity usually works.
 MATT: The two mutated guards now, their armor bulging and broken in places, turn to the noises in the tent where you guys are.
 SAM: Are we in the same tent or are we in two different tents?
 MATT: You guys are all in one tent with the other girls. You are all jammed into the space. The two of you make your way outside of the large tent as you watch these two bulging, zombified creatures making their way towards the tent. And that’s where we’re going to pick up next time.
 (groaning)
 MATT: Because it is 11 now.
 TRAVIS: But we’re not supposed to be there! We’ll get framed for it!
 MARISHA: Exactly, we can’t get framed!
 SAM: Can I just say, Laura and I busted the case *wide open*!
 (laughter)
 TRAVIS: That is true!
 SAM: We solved the case. Easy.
 LAURA: Totally.
 SAM: Couple inquisitions. Following the clues
 LAURA: That’s right.
 TALIESIN: Just one more question.
 TRAVIS: When that demon frog leapt, how high and how far, approximately, did it look like it went?
 MATT: It looks like it leapt about 20 to 25 feet in the air and traveled about 40 feet with the leap. It was a large arc.
 LAURA: So we definitely can't fight that thing.
 TRAVIS: Sure we can.
 LAURA: Oh my god.
 TRAVIS: Oh god.
 MATT: You saw it escape northward from where you are.
 MARISHA: And did it look like the same figure?
 MATT: Yasha ran north, northeast.This is just straight north of where you are. Towards the Ustaloch.
 MARISHA: Towards Ustaloch! It's the fucking lake!
 TRAVIS: Oh man, this is good, dude!
 MARISHA: See, here's my thing. Does anyone else notice that the zombie transformations seem like a serpent shedding its skin? Because they always slough off their skin?
 TRAVIS: It's also done without any contact.
 MARISHA: Wait, what?
 TRAVIS: It's done without any contact. He never touches him.
 LAURA: Yeah, he touched him, didn't he?
 MATT: No. 
 LAURA: I thought he did.
 MATT: No, they just suddenly began to erupt in--
 LAURA: Hey, bonus news, though. The charm spell guy isn't going to turn me dead!
 MATT: Look at that silver lining!
 TALIESIN: This season got dark. Season got dark.
 LAURA: Whoa. Tight tight tight tight.
 TRAVIS: Good shit. Little damaged voice, fuck yeah. 
 MATT: That'll be fun. 
 LAURA: I wanted to cough for her.
 MATT: We'll pick up there next week. The chase is on, apparently. Thank you guys so much for being awesome. Thank you guys for coming along and watching with us. We'll pick this up next Thursday where we left off, right in the middle of this campsite. Until then, have a wonderful week. See you guys then. Is it Thursday yet?
 
  
Part I Edit 
 MATT: Welcome back. Last we left off, this intrepid band of slowly converging individual stories into some semblance of an adventuring party have found themselves caught up in an investigation. There was a carnival you attended, which Mollymauk was a part of, that had a terrible scenario occur. An older man who was at the carnival had been transformed in the middle of a performance into some horrible undead creature that attacked and assaulted other people within the tent. You defeated it and since have all been under investigation and been told you can't leave the town. To try and absolve yourselves of any sort of doubt, you've begun to investigate what the cause is for this strange transformation. You've gone around the town asking questions, meeting individuals, eventually finding yourselves back at the tent in the middle of the night, past midnight, in the early hours of the morning, sneaking into tents and asking members of the carnival what they may know about what has transpired. Upon speaking with a number of members of the carnival, two of the guards that were on site suddenly fell dead where they were standing, writhing in pain as they passed. You watched as a large shadow, which you had confirmed being fiendish in nature, leapt northward towards the Ustaloch and out of sight as both Fjord and Caleb rushed out of the main tent to see the center of the camp where these two bodies begin to rise up, two more of the freshly transformed undead creatures now angered and looking about for something to feast upon. And that was where we left off.
 TRAVIS: Totally good.
 SAM: No problem with our setup.
 LAURA: That was the third spell, by the way. Detect Good and Evil.
 MATT: Okay, there you go. So how many spells do you have left?
 LAURA: No spells. I've got cantrips though, so don't worry, guys.
 TALIESIN: No burger left. Just onion rings.
 LAURA: Just the fried piece. Not even an onion left in there.
 MATT: I would like you all to roll initiative, please.
 TRAVIS: Oh, right off the bat?
 MATT: Yeah!
 SAM: We're fighting already?
 MARISHA: Oh, natural 20!
 SAM: I rolled her dice, it was a one, I'm never rolling it again.
 LAURA: Oh! Yours rolled a one, too.
 (laughter)
 TRAVIS: We rolled low. Level two!
 MATT: All righty. 20 to 15.
 MARISHA: 24.
 MATT: Beau at the top. 15 to 10?
 LIAM: Elf. 11.
 SAM: Is that German?
 LIAM: Ja.
 MATT: Ten to five.
 SAM: Five.
 TALIESIN: Eight. That's a number.
 MATT: That it is. You?
 TRAVIS: Nope. Three.
 LIAM: Three!
 LAURA: You have three initiative? What's your initiative?
 LIAM: What's your modifier?
 TRAVIS: Zero.
 MATT: So. Five.
 LIAM: Holy. Shit.
 MATT: The good news is they didn't roll very high, either, but still better than a lot of you. And then three and three?
 LAURA: No, I'm four.
 MATT: Okay, there we go. 
 TRAVIS: You're one, right?
 SAM: I have five. One plus four.
 LIAM: And you're one plus nothing?
 LAURA: One plus three.
 MATT: You watch as these two zombified guards, their brass-colored scale armor clanking as their forms rise up, looking around, peer past the shadowed darkness around the campfire lighting the interior. The horses grow nervous as you watch both Caleb and Fjord emerge from the tent right in their sights. They both begin to lumber in your direction.
 TRAVIS: Son of a bitch.
 SAM: You guys are out in the open?
 LAURA: Yeah, they're just sitting there.
 LIAM: We just walked out of the tent door and are looking at that.
 TRAVIS: Thank god there's that cart right there.
 LIAM: We're safe.
 MATT: They come right up to you.
 LAURA: They are fast moving zombies!
 MATT: Well, that's all it can do. It dashed. It lurches towards them. They move a little bit quicker than you'd expect, but not necessarily that quick. They both spend their full turns trying to close the gap. The horses immediately freak out and start running this direction in a gallop.
 LIAM: Oh, damn it.
 TRAVIS: There goes that idea.
 TALIESIN: It was such a good idea.
 SAM: The horses have their own initiative.
 MATT: That's going to go ahead and end their go. Beau, you're up.
 MARISHA: I turn to Jester and Molly. Fucking, we probably shouldn't kill crownsguard, even if it's a zombie. Should we go after the toad?
 LAURA: We should probably kill the zombies because anybody that gets bitten by a zombie turns into another zombie!
 MARISHA: I don't want to be a guard killer. All right, fine.
 TALIESIN: I don't want to be a fucking zombie.
 TRAVIS: We just can't be here.
 MARISHA: Can I peek out and see the guard-zombies?
 TALIESIN: They did run by.
 MATT: You watch them as you peek under the tent and they both just ran to the right.
 MARISHA: Can I crawl out from under the tent and clear the gap with them and get up to them?
 TALIESIN: Oh, fancy.
 SAM: Cool map.
 MATT: That's as close as you can get right there. You can go into a dash if you wanted to engage directly.
 MARISHA: Oh, man, I don't know what to do.
 TRAVIS: It's all right. Work it out.
 MATT: Actually, this is my fault. I rolled for the zombies to see who they saw first, but technically their turn hadn't come up yet. That's my fault, because their initiative is lower in the order, so we're going to retcon a little bit of that. That's still there.
 TRAVIS: (singing) Rewind!
 MATT: Because your initiative was super high. That's totally my bad. It's early enough in the combat where it's not going to make a huge difference. But you do watch as they turn and they look past the direction like they're ready to dart towards the actual large carnival tent.
 LAURA: Now I just want to do Hamilton with all our character voices.
 MARISHA: After Jester trying to help me, can I close the gap to this guy?
 MATT: You can at this point, yeah. It's two squares to get there.
 TRAVIS: Look at that mini!
 LAURA: Oh, you're out there all by yourself! Beau!
 MARISHA: It's cool, man.
 TRAVIS: Cut them down with those guns.
 MARISHA: Is that fire still going?
 MATT: It's not a huge blaze, but there's some flames in it. It's starting to burn out a little bit.
 TRAVIS: Both barrels. Six shooter. Give it to them.
 MARISHA: Okay. With my initial attack as I run up, can I take my staff and try and take them out at the knees? Just a sweep?
 MATT: Sure. I'd say go ahead and make an athletics check.
 TRAVIS: Knock them prone?
 MARISHA: Yeah, that's what I'm going for.
 MATT: Make an athletics check.
 MARISHA: That's not great. Nine.
 MATT: Rolled a natural 20 on his end.
 MARISHA: Shit!
 MATT: As you swing with the staff, it slams into the side of the guard's leg and you hear the slight crack of wood as the armored exterior of the zombified form seems to stand resolute against the strength of your blow. Its head, which was turned off angrily towards the shadowed direction of Caleb and Fjord, turns back, the red burning coals for eyes now glaring in your direction. What are you doing?
 MARISHA: I look at him and I say, you fucking broke my stick! I'm going to do an elbow to the face and then another punch with the staff still in my hand and do Flurry of Blows.
 MATT: Well, you did your one attack to sweep him. It's an unarmed attack for your next two.
 MARISHA: Right, I know. I'm doing an elbow and a punch, I'm just holding my staff.
 MATT: Right. Misunderstood. Okay, go for it. Roll for the attack.
 MARISHA: Two attacks, right?
 MATT: You got it.
 MARISHA: Oh god, this makes me so nervous. That's good! 19 for the first one.
 MATT: 19 hits.
 MARISHA: Oh, and a natural one for the second.
 MATT: You guys with the ones at the start of this fight!
 LAURA: I don't know what's happening!
 MATT: Roll damage for the first one.
 TRAVIS: You can't be too cocky.
 MATT: I know, apparently.
 MARISHA: Eight?
 LAURA: What's new at the table?
 TALIESIN: Everything.
 MATT: Eight points of damage. As you elbow across, wham! You watch as the jaw hangs and dislodges a bit, and as its head turns towards you, you reach with your other first and it catches it in the middle of the air and it tries to bite at your arm, but the jaw hangs open, not able to actually find any purchase in your arm. I believe that ends your turn. Caleb, you're up.
 LIAM: I am going to move over a bit towards that carriage and I pull the diamond out of my component pouch and a small prismatic ball forms over it. I take my other hand and spin it really fast and little ice shards start shooting out of the side. I take it with the free hand and I'm going to throw it like a fucking baseball pitcher at the one closest to Beauregard.
 MATT: Right there? Okay. So go ahead and roll your attack on that.
 LIAM: DandD Beyond, where did you go? Oh, that's good! 23.
 MATT: 23 definitely hits.
 LIAM: Okay. So that is cold damage. 3d8. Come on! Nine total.
 MATT: Nine points of cold damage to it. You watch as it's trying to bite with no effect towards Beau's arm as she's pulling away. The sphere slams into the side of its shoulder, it would be this side, and it pulls back. You watch as the arm breaks a bit and the ice shards coalesce around the outside of the armor and linger with this frost and mist that sprays off the impact. It looks fairly damaged.
 LIAM: Question, am I supposed to roll initiative for Frumpkin as well?
 MATT: Technically by the rules, yes. But it might be easier to have you guys go at the same time.
 LIAM: Okay, if that's what you want to do.
 MATT: Sure, for now.
 LIAM: I'm sending Frumpkin to zip under that tent. He has 40 feet of movement.
 MATT: This one here?
 LIAM: Yeah.
 MATT: Easy enough. Frumpkin is underneath there.
 TRAVIS: What's inside?
 MARISHA: What's in the tent?
 TRAVIS: (sneezing) Fucking cat.
 MATT: That your turn?
 LIAM: That's it, ja.
 MATT: Molly, you're up.
 TALIESIN: I'm going to burst out of the tent. Can I make it to the one that Beau is fighting?
 MATT: (counting) You can indeed.
 TALIESIN: I'm going to make it to the one that Beau is fighting and I'm going to take two straight attacks with my scimitar.
 MATT: Go for it. You see half of its body encased in ice now, and it's still lashing out in Beau's direction as you rush up.
 TALIESIN: That's a 15 and a natural 20.
 MATT: Okay then!
 TALIESIN: Without even figuring out, yeah.
 LAURA: Fifteen plus whatever.
 MATT: Those both hit.
 TALIESIN: Natural 20 is just double the die, right?
 MATT: Yeah.
 TRAVIS: Come on, iron snitch.
 LAURA: Make up for our shortcomings, Taliesin!
 MATT: Which one's which?
 TALIESIN: First one is (counting) 15? 
 TRAVIS: Yeah, dude.
 TALIESIN: No, double, I have to roll two dice, right?
 MATT: The first attack is that die, so that's not the critical.
 TALIESIN: Okay, that's fine. That's nine points of damage. Then two dice or double the dice?
 MATT: We'll just double the die, it's fine. It's fun to do it that way. Less dice to have to roll.
 TALIESIN: That's 13 points of damage.
 MATT: Ha, nope. So you watch as it's slashing at Beau. The ice explodes in its side and Mollymauk comes walking out of the tent, both of the scimitars spinning in his hand like this dervish entity. As he slams both blades simultaneously into the sides of this creature, he cuts a v shape into the upper torso and it slips out of it. The central portion of its body slips onto the ground with a splat and the arms fall to the side and the body collapses onto the ground.
 TALIESIN: I turn and smile at Beau. 
 MARISHA: Thanks.
 LAURA: You cut like a little v cake with head.
 TALIESIN: It's a pizza pie with a pizza slice. I turn 180 and get ready for the other one.
 MARISHA: Doesn't make me trust you any more. Less, actually.
 MATT: Which is now its turn. Having you rush out of the tent, its attention once in the distance, it traces you over as you attack its ally. It lunges over towards you and makes two strikes in your direction.
 TALIESIN: I make eye contact with it and, fuck it, just for fun I'm going to burn my blood maledict. There's going to be a blood vessel that pops on my neck and I'm going to make him cry.
 MATT: The bulging red eyes suddenly go black and thick droplets of blood-like ichor begins to spill out the corners of the zombie's eyes. 
 TALIESIN: I take three damage. 
 MATT: Oh are you--
 TALIESIN: I’m amplifying 
 MATT: You take three damage. This attack and the next attack he has disadvantage on. 
 MARISHA: Ooh shit, that's awesome! 
 MATT: 16 and an eight for the first attack so that bring it down to a 12 to hit.
 TALIESIN: No.
 MATT: As it rushes towards you, you can see the opening as it swings too wide and you duck right out of the way. Second attack with disadvantage as well. That's a 19 and a 16, so the 16 plus four that's 20, so it still hits.
 TALIESIN: It still hits. That's fine.
 MATT: The first one you duck out of the way. However, the secondary slam hits you for five points of bludgeoning damage across your shoulder. You get pushed back into Beau and Beau catches your fall.
 TRAVIS: Not the jacket!
 TALIESIN: Ow.
 MATT:That ends its go. Nott you are up.
 SAM: It's still alive?
 MATT: Yeah.
 SAM: Nott is going to hard charge out of the tent. Not at the beast, but across the courtyard. Yes. As fast as she can go, saying: Shit shit shit! Can she make it to that box?
 MATT: She can't, unfortunately. 
 SAM: She can't?
 MATT: No, it's (counting). You can get to right there.
 SAM: As she's running, she's going to fire her crossbow at the dude. 11 plus six, 17.
 MATT: That hits.
 ALL: Ooh!
 (laughter) 
 TRAVIS: Your dice just ollied off of the side of your dice tray! If this was Tony Hawk, you would be accumulating points still, it's riding it up.
 LIAM: I’ve seen this Twilight episode. He knows what is behind your screen the rest of the game!
 MARISHA: Give him the multiplier!
 MATT: There you go.
 SAM: Okay, so that is seven points of damage and sneak attack damage? 
 MATT: Correct, as it is adjacent to Molly.
 SAM: Another two points.
 MATT: Okay. 
 SAM: Oh! And why not? I'll use Fury of the Small! Add another two points. 
 MATT: That's a full ten points of damage to him.
 SAM: Yes and then bonus action can I just hide behind that thing?
 MATT: You can't hide behind it because you’d have to get behind it, but you can use your bonus action to dash and get behind it. You're not going to be hiding, but you'll move in this direction. 
 LAURA: Oh, that's what rouges can do, they can use their bonus action to dash?
 SAM: Apparently?
 MATT: Yep. You get behind. "Oh god!" That finishes your turn, Nott. That brings us to Jester! You're up!
 LAURA: Oh okay! I'm going to sit down on the ground and open the tent. 
 MATT: And look out?
 LAURA: And look out. 
 MATT: You see this sudden interaction of everyone, or at least Beau and Molly leaping towards the standing zombie. 
 LAURA: Then I say: Oh shit, I should not have used all those spells earlier. All I have is Sacred Flame, and I'm going to do that. I'm going to shoot Sacred Flame and at the same time I'm going to go: Frumpkin, come here, let me pet you!
 MATT: All right so Sacred Flame is a saving throw for the--
 LAURA: Yeah, it's a 13 dexterity. 
 MATT: It actually rolled exactly a 13 with no modifiers, so it does succeed. 
 LAURA: That doesn't do any damage then?
 MATT: Well, what does it say on the spell, is it half damage or no damage?
 LAURA: It just says that's it.
 MATT: Okay then yeah, sorry. 
 LAURA: Balls! (Coughs) Shit. Frumpkin! Lumpy, come here.
 MATT: Let me double check that.
 LAURA: Sorry, guys.
 MATT: That finishes Jester's turn. Fjord, you’re up.
 TRAVIS: Oh yeah, can I fucking run up past the cart? Charge into the fray with my 30 speed.
 MATT: That's about as close as you can get right there.
 TRAVIS: Can I pull out my falchion? I’ll flip it over so it's pommel up and I will use Eldritch Blast towards the remaining zombie.
 MATT: As you hold your arm out in force, the edge of the pommel glows with this dark, black, purple, crackling energy, and this single bolt of Eldritch energy fires out in the direction. Roll for the attack.
 TRAVIS: That is a 14.
 MATT: That hits, roll damage.
 SAM: Travis is using magic.
 TRAVIS: I'm telling you, it's all happening you guys! That is nine points of damage.
 MATT: Nine points of damage, nice. It hits and the armor dents inward, to the point where if it was still a living human, it probably would've caused some serious internal bleeding or bludgeoning, but the creature seems relatively unphased by the impact, other than being pushed onto one foot then back on its, two-foot weight. That ends your turn.
 TRAVIS: I look around and say we need to drop this fucker and get the hell out of Dodge.
 MATT: Beau, you're up.
 MARISHA: Okay, back to the top. I'm going to do with my two-handed, I'm going to use my quarterstaff two-handed and come down and try and crack it over his head.
 MATT: All right, you have to move over to him, though.
 MARISHA: Okay, can I step over the dead guy. Sorry, excuse me.
 MATT: You vault off of the corpse of the other zombie guard and then leap down with your staff towards him, go for it.
 MARISHA: Goddamn it, fuck, balls and shit. 13.
 MATT: 13 still hits.
 MARISHA: Yeah! Fuck yeah!
 TRAVIS: If you weren't drinking a sea anemone.
 MARISHA: You're so weirded out about it. 11 points of damage.
 MATT: 11 points of damage. Wham! You slam into it and watch as it (impact). It's starting to look pretty beat up, but it's still standing.
 TRAVIS: Damn, that armor's helping it, huh?
 MATT: You have a bonus action if you still want it.
 MARISHA: I can hit again with my bonus, right? I’m still trying to figure this out.
 MATT: Every turn, as long as you're attacking with your action, you can bonus attack with you unarmed strike. Then use a ki point to double attack if you want.
 MARISHA: Right. Learning these combat abilities, it's weird. Okay. I'm going to be like: Ugh, die! I'm going to do a big roundhouse kick to his head.
 MATT: Go for it, roll for the attack.
 TRAVIS: That's awesome.
 MARISHA: That's good, that's a 16!
 MATT: 16 hits! Go ahead and roll damage.
 MARISHA: That's an unarmed strike? Okay, eight points!
 MATT: Eight points?!
 MARISHA: It's a two, plus-- No, wait! I'm sorry, six points. I was looking at the wrong thing.
 MATT: That's okay. Six points of damage. Whack! You slam it in the side of the head with a roundhouse kick and watch as the neck snaps and the head is stick there like (snarling). It's trying to snarl, but you can hear the windpipe is closed off at the angle that it got snapped and it's making this horrible choking sound.
 MARISHA: I go, “Ugh, Molly!”
 MATT: Caleb, your turn.
 LIAM: Okay I'm also tapped as well. I'm going to back up against the tent that we came out of and with a sinking pit in my stomach, my hand starts to blacken and flake and fire springs from the palm and it shoots, and I cast Fire Bolt.
 MATT: Roll for the attack.
 LAURA: Is that a cantrip?
 LIAM: That is a cantrip, yeah. That's good though, that's 17.
 MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.
 LIAM: That's 1d10, that's this guy here that I never used in the last campaign. Oh, that's four.
 MATT: Four points of damage. All right. The bolt slams into the side of its head where it was hit by Beau, and actually snaps it back into place. You watch its eyes lull for a second and it comes back with renewed undead strength.
 LAURA: *Renewed* undead strength?
 TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Undead strength.
 MATT: Renewed in the sense that for a second you watched the light flicker out but it seems to push through by the force of the enchantment that holds it aloft.
 MARISHA: Beau goes: Who undid my work?
 LIAM: I probably have a little bit of movement left.
 MATT: You've got ten feet.
 LIAM: I would like to sidle into the tent that I exited before and disappear. Frumpkin will dart across behind Molly to the little tent.
 LAURA: No, don't leave me!
 MATT: (Counting) What's the movement on Frumpkin?
 LIAM: 40.
 MATT: All right. That's your turn?
 LIAM: Yeah, that's it.
 MATT: All right. Molly, you're up.
 TALIESIN: I'm going to take two more shots, I'm going to see if I can decapitate--
 MATT: Two more shots?
 TALIESIN: Oh man! I've got to get out of that habit.
 LAURA: Two more swings?
 TALIESIN: Two more swings, see if I can decapitate it.
 LAURA: Two more flourishes.
 TALIESIN: That's an eight.
 MATT: Eight? Misses.
 TALIESIN: But a 16 does not.
 MATT: 16 does hit. Go ahead and roll damage.
 TALIESIN: That's nine points of damage.
 MATT: As the blade sinks into its shoulder and you see it carves in and jams halfway through the torso, the armor stopping it part way before it lodges in, and it leans forward. (growling) It's still standing, and your blade's stuck in the abdomen.
 LAURA: Renewed, undead strength.
 MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Molly. It's going to take its first slam, swipe at you. Since you're immediately in front of it. That's a natural 20. I'm rolling some good 20s tonight.
 TRAVIS: What dice did you use?
 MATT: What other dice?
 TRAVIS: (screaming) No, look what you did!
 MATT: Of course it's the snitch.
 TRAVIS: It came back to bite you in the anus.
 TALIESIN: This is not looking good.
 MATT: 11 points of bludgeoning damage.
 TALIESIN: Oh my god.
 MATT: (Whoosh) It clocks you across the side of the temple. You're vision goes blurring for a second. You spit across the ground. You're used to the sight of your own blood, but now it's across the grass and dirt at your foot. You start to feel yourself get a bit woozy. It's going to go ahead and spin around and strike you with its open claw with the other arm.
 TALIESIN: I swear I thought I could kill it.
 MATT: That's going to be a 16 to hit?
 TALIESIN: That hits.
 SAM: Man down.
 TRAVIS: Come on, baby.
 MATT: That is nine points of bludgeoning damage.
 TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I'm out.
 TRAVIS: (laughing) Yeah, first one!
 MARISHA: Oh shit!
 TRAVIS: Write the history books.
 MATT: You guys watch as the first hit clocks Molly hard. The second one is this clawing uppercut. He goes backwards dropping one scimitar; the other one being left, stuck in the body of the undead guard. As it now glances back towards to beau to its right. That's the end of Molly's turn, and the zombie's turn. Nott, you're up.
 TRAVIS: You didn't fall into the fire, right?
 MATT: No, he fell straight back.
 TRAVIS: Are you sure?
 MATT: If he rolled a one, we'd talk.
 TALIESIN: I think I'm immune to fire, anyways or some such thing.
 MATT: Fire resistance?
 TALIESIN: Yeah, fire resistance.
 TRAVIS: Because of your magical, technicolor dreamcoat?
 MATT: Nott, what do you got? You just watched Molly go down.
 TALIESIN: Out, but not dead.
 SAM: Seeing one of us die scares the shit out of me.
 MATT: Unconscious.
 SAM: No, dead forever.
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: I've just started working on a new character tonight. Thank god.
 SAM: I start charging out at the beast.
 MATT: All right.
 SAM: I get about halfway. I fire my crossbow (wailing scream).
 TRAVIS: So brave.
 SAM: That's a natural 20.
 (cheering)
 LAURA: With sneak attack you double your dice.
 MATT: How do you want to do this?
 (cheering)
 MATT: It doesn't even matter the damage you deal. If the damage from a critical hit, it doesn't get its undead fortitude.
 (cheering)
 SAM: I'm low to the ground so probably in the back of the calf or something. Before it falls, I'm going to turn and run into the tent. I don't even know if I hit. (screaming)
 LIAM: That's my girl.
 MATT: Molly, as you watch it turn around towards you, suddenly it lurches as a crossbow bolt shatters its kneecap from behind. Its other leg, which had been partially damaged from the process of getting up and combat that's happened isn't enough to keep it aloft. It tumbles back into the fire and immediately begins to burn as it begins to scream and squeal. See the flames begin to burn and engulf its body before eventually it comes to rest, no longer held by this undead magic that keeps it standing. Quiet falls over the encampment. Molly. Well, next up, as this is now important, Jester it's your turn.
 LAURA: I come running out of the tent. Say: Molly! Oh shit, oh no! Okay. I kneel down next to him and I'll do Spare the Dying cantrip.
 SAM: It's a cantrip?
 LAURA: Yes. It took someone going unconscious, guys.
 SAM: It's designed for this moment.
 MATT: That being the case, you become stable.
 TALIESIN: (gasps)
 MATT: You're not conscious yet, but you're stable. You don't have to make--
 LAURA: Can I try and do some medicine on him. Does that heal him at all?
 MATT: Do you have a healer's kit?
 LAURA: I don't think so.
 TRAVIS: She has desserts.
 LAURA: I have doughnuts, some paint supplies.
 MATT: Beau as you're standing here, Molly is no longer bleeding out. He’s breathing and coughing in the unconsciousness from the pain. You watch as Jester is fiddling through her bag, pulling things out.
 MARISHA: You have a six pack of donuts, but you don't have a healer's kit in there? And you're the cleric? I'm confused.
 LAURA: I'm *the* cleric? What is this? I've never traveled with a bunch of people that I thought would die in front of me, okay? I never needed a healer's kit before.
 MARISHA: Well, congratulations, you're the cleric now.
 LAURA: (gasps) You have a healer's kit? Oh my gosh. I've always wanted one of these for so long.
 MARISHA: I'll give it to her. Here, it's a gift. Congratulations-on-you-being-in-a-new group gift.
 LAURA: How do I use this?
 SAM: Oh no, she's not proficient.
 LAURA: I open it and rummage through a bunch of shit here.
 TRAVIS: No vanilla extract or sprinkles?
 MATT: I'll say for the instance of this, since it's not necessarily immediate danger of him dying off. Go ahead and make a medicine check.
 SAM: Use my dice that I gave you.
 LAURA: Should I?
 SAM: Yes.
 LAURA: What if I roll a one on it?
 SAM: That's what I'm hoping for.
 SAM: That's a strong four.
 LAURA: A nine?
 MATT: Okay, I'll say-- (sighs). He's still unconscious. Given a little bit of time, he'll come back to consciousness. Ten minutes or so. You can probably, eventually through the use of strong vapors or something you can bring him back from the brink. At this point the rest of the carnival currently within the vicinity begin to emerge from the tents seeing that the danger has passed.
 SAM: Is there any young girl in the tent with me?
 MATT: Make a perception check.
 SAM: Natural 20.
 MATT: You glance around the interior of the chamber which has a unique smell to the inside. You smelled it before, but it catches you very strongly now that there's quiet and you're not focused on anything else. A very faint smell of brimstone lingers within the tent, mingling with the wet grass. You look around and see no girl.
 LIAM: What does happen is Frumpkin scrabbles up your back and comes to your shoulder, and I'm watching everything from my hidey hole.
 MARISHA: I immediately drop down and start searching the guard.
 LAURA: Yeah, is any of their armor still usable? Because we can pretend we're guards for some reason.
 MATT: The one that he cleaved, the armor is not functional at all. The other one, the last one to die, the armor is still functional. It is dented and beat up, but it's still functional. There's the slightly tarnished brass armor. Then there's the red maroon color. It's like a scale mail chestplate and armplates for it. It could be used but it's still a big piece of armor. You'd have to lug it around or wear it.
 TRAVIS: We still look like Crownsguard.
 LAURA: Oh.
 MATT: You both do, currently.
 TRAVIS: Caleb and I.
 LIAM: We probably have a half hour at this point?
 MATT: About, yeah.
 LAURA: We should get out of here soon though because guards could be coming.
 TRAVIS: Did anybody see what happened or where that hellish toad went?
 LAURA: It jumped off that way.
 TRAVIS: You saw it?
 LAURA: Yeah.
 MATT: The Knot twins emerge like, "Where are the guards, the rest of them? Are more coming or is this all of them?"
 LAURA: There's probably more coming, I would think.
 TRAVIS: We can't be here.
 MATT: "Do you think we should run?"
 MARISHA: We should hide the evidence.
 TRAVIS: What? Where?
 MARISHA: I don't know.
 LAURA: I don't know who should run where.
 TALIESIN: (groans)
 LAURA: I have his head in my lap and I'm slapping his cheek consistently.
 MARISHA: Was there nothing useful on the guard?
 MATT: As you continue to search through, aside from the armor that seems functional, each of them have a basic longsword.
 TALIESIN: One of them have my sword embedded in their chest.
 MATT: Yes. Which can be pulled out. Between the two of them you can gather about six gold pieces and four silver pieces.
 LAURA: Ooh!
 TRAVIS: I don't want to get these folk in any more trouble. How far is it from here to the lake?
 MATT: Glancing off to the side you can see the lake is maybe 400 to 500 feet north.
 TRAVIS: I say we could drag them and throw them into the lake to avoid suspicion on the carnival. We’ve got to get out of here.
 MARISHA: How well did the fire burn the other body? Did it do pretty well or--
 MATT: It's pretty burned. The maroon robes on the one armor is damaged and can possibly be salvaged. The armor on the one that is burned can be used. The robes or the maroon cloth is burned away entirely. The armor looks like its been burned. It has blackened, charcoal edges to it.
 LIAM: Nott, you feel Frumpkin's claws slowly and deliberately squeeze into your shoulder.
 SAM: That means I have to go.
 TRAVIS: Where's Caleb?
 MARISHA: I thought he was with you.
 TRAVIS: He was. I look around for Caleb.
 MATT: Okay. If you're right there, you're not far from the tent. You head back and see he's not on the outside of the tent.
 SAM: The smell of sulfur, I mean brimstone, do I figure that it's probably the residual from the big toad guy or is there a substance in the room that causing it?
 MATT: Make a religion check.
 SAM: A religion check? One.
 (laughter)
 MATT: You believe the little girl may have tooted before where she went to where she is.
 TRAVIS: That's a devastating toot.
 SAM: I'm going to try and get out of the tent through the side. Like underneath the side and towards the horse. Yeah, back there. Looking for Caleb.
 MATT: You glance over and you don't see Caleb. You do see Fjord is in the process of looking in the area. You walk up and Caleb is nowhere near the tent on the outside. You don't know where he is.
 TRAVIS: Nott, have you seen Caleb?
 SAM: No, not yet. Is he okay? Did he live? Did everyone live?
 TRAVIS: You got his little cat right there on your shoulder.
 SAM: Oh yes I do, hi. Yeah, so he can't be far.
 TRAVIS: We need to get out of here. We need to follow after that toad.
 SAM: Okay. There's horses around here, let's steal them.
 TRAVIS: That's actually not a terrible idea.
 LAURA: Ooh good, we can put Molly on the back of the wagon. That way we can get him out of here. And the guards' bodies, too! That way we can drop them off away from the carnival and people won't think it's related.
 MARISHA: Oh my god, you are so speaking my language.
 LAURA: I'm a very wise person.
 TRAVIS: That's a great idea. Let's do that.
 LAURA: Okay.
 TRAVIS: Who wants to help me with the one totally charred body?
 LAURA: I'll do it. I go pick him up and carry him.
 MATT: An impressive display of physical strength. The little, adorable tiefling, without an issue lifts the body out of the charred bits of burnt wood and charcoal.
 TRAVIS: Shit. Never would have known.
 MARISHA: I grab the other body and start dragging it or at least its torso.
 TRAVIS: I'll help you.
 MATT: Ornna gives a hand and helps you. The Knot sisters look like they want to be absolved of this whole scenario and look like they're about to flee at any moment.
 SAM: Might I point out real quick, up to this point we are fugitives who haven't committed a crime. But starting now we will be fugitive who have committed crimes. Are we sure we want to do this?
 TRAVIS: I mean it's either that or leave the carnival and take the fall for what is two dead crownsguard.
 SAM: All right, let's go. But I have to find Caleb first.
 LIAM: Caleb gets over it and he comes out and starts helping push the bodies onto the-- doesn't say anything, but starts pushing bodies onto the back of the cart.
 TRAVIS: Where'd you go?
 LIAM: This is not my thing. I am not brave like Nott. Let's get out of here, please.
 TRAVIS: You shot shit out of your hands. I don't think you were not brave. That was really impressive.
 MARISHA: Wait, you were shooting shit out of your hands?
 TRAVIS: It was fire. It's a figure of fucking speech.
 MARISHA: Oh.
 LIAM: I haven't learned that one yet. Some day.
 LAURA: Somebody needs to grab Molly. He's still over there.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, okay. We go back over there and we fucking grab Molly. I grab him by his horn.
 MATT: As you're dragging Molly, Molly, your eyes lull open and you're at one hit point. Come to consciousness.
 TALIESIN: I'm at one hit point?
 MATT: You're being dragged.
 MARISHA: I start hooking up the horses.
 MATT: Okay. You're hooking them all up to?
 MARISHA: Yeah, one is going to hook up to the wagon and I'll-- which wagon do we want to take?
 LAURA: The one with the two horses attached, yo. Can you see it?
 MARISHA: Yeah.
 LAURA: We'll take that one.
 MARISHA: Okay.
 LAURA: Unhook the other horse so we can steal that one, too.
 MATT: As you guys are doing this, the two Knot sisters talking to each other, look around, and they go running to the southeast.
 LAURA: They're outies.
 SAM: Should I shoot them?
 TALIESIN: They're okay.
 TRAVIS: Is that single horse a mustang?
 LAURA: Oh my god.
 TALIESIN: Really?
 TRAVIS: What? Can I ask a simple question?
 MARISHA: We better get $100,000 from Ford for that one. We better fucking get that.
 MATT: Sure.
 TRAVIS: It's not a mare? I'm just checking.
 MATT: No, no it is.
 TRAVIS: I'm just very curious as to the sex of it, that's all.
 MATT: Roll a perception check.
 TRAVIS: 12. No, 14.
 MATT: That is a mustang.
 LIAM: Is its name Roy?
 SAM: The white one?
 TRAVIS: Yeah.
 TALIESIN: Are you going to name it Sally?
 TRAVIS: You'll find out.
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: I had that coming.
 LIAM: During all the busywork, I'm not saying anything, but I keep giving worried and stressed glances at my little friend.
 LAURA: Don't worry, Caleb, I'm okay.
 MATT: You guys have the bodies loaded up, both the charred and the slashed one, onto the cart.
 TALIESIN: I'm going to pull my sword back out and start trying to get the horses going.
 LAURA: He's alive! You're awake! 
 TALIESIN: That really hurt.
 LAURA: How do you feel?
 TALIESIN: I feel terrible.
 LAURA: I saved your life. You should be really grateful. 
 TALIESIN: I can do that.
 MARISHA: Molly, I appreciate you trying to rally the horses right now, but I really think you should rest.
 TALIESIN: No, I'm fine. I'm going to actually fall back into the cart.
 MARISHA: I take the reins. 
 MATT: All right. Easy enough to find any sort of material if you wanted to cover the contents of the cart. You guys are ready to go. Ornna is standing there alone. "I think I should stay here."
 LAURA: Are you sure?
 MATT: "What, and be a fugitive? I can explain what happened. Hopefully."
 LAURA: What are you going to say to them?
 MATT: "Exactly what happened. The same thing that turned these guards ran off and you're hoping to stop it."
 LAURA: Don't say that we were here. Don't mention we were here. That's pretty important, I think. Yeah? 
 TRAVIS: You couldn't see us in the low light, but they chased after whatever caused this.
 MATT: "Okay. I can do that. I can't leave Gustav and Bosun in prison to take the fall for this."
 LAURA: We'll get them out of it.
 LIAM: Would you have the abilities to burn these things up the way we did? Are you capable? Could you have killed these things? Is that believable for people who know you? 
 MATT: "I'm quite good with fire. That's not entirely impossible."
 MARISHA: Ornna, is there anything else that you can think of that could possibly help us? Like why this toad decided to freak out right now? Anything that comes to mind before we go chase after your mess.
 TRAVIS: Any previous episodes of this kind?
 MATT: "No. Never trusted anything that looked the way Kylre did. Everyone seemed to put a lot of trust in him. Gustav did. Toya did. I don't know if this is still a misunderstanding, but--" She points over to where there's splatters of blood in the middle of the grass. The leftover carnage from the battle. "Just get this figured out, please. This is all I have left." She looks around the empty encampment. She stands amongst the four empty tents by herself.
 SAM: Toya's gone, right? 
 MATT: Toya’s gone.
 LAURA: What happened to her? Did it take Toya with it? 
 LIAM: Yeah, she frogged out. 
 TRAVIS: We'll try and find some evidence that will exonerate you and we'll return.
 LAURA: We need to find evidence to exonerate us.
 SAM: Sorry that we thought that you did it. Briefly.
 MATT: "It's okay. It's hard for some folks to trust carnival folk. Just as hard as it is for some folks to trust little green folk.”
 (laughter)
 TRAVIS: We should really get to stepping.
 LAURA: Let's go.
 SAM: Saddle up. 
 MATT: You hop on your mustang.
 TRAVIS: I do. Shelby. 
 MARISHA: Oh, god!
 TRAVIS: Just deliver it to the PO Box, that’s fine.
 TALIESIN: Everything that you've been holding back for years now is going to come pouring out of you. Okay.
 MATT: You have the cart and the horses at your disposal. What are you guys doing?
 TALIESIN: Trying to take as much of a short rest as I can back there. I'm going to try and sleep this off like a bad hangover.
 LIAM: I will attempt to do the same to do arcane recovery.
 MATT: Okay. The two of you saddle up on the back of the cart as it makes its way northward.
 SAM: Where are we going? 
 TRAVIS: In the direction the toad leapt.
 LAURA: Are we really chasing the toad right now? Molly obviously did the most damage out of anyone and he's almost dead right now.
 MARISHA: Maybe we can at least find him, stake him out, and then we'll rest.
 LAURA: We are going to rest, right? We can't just chase after a toad. We'll die.
 TRAVIS: We might need to play it by ear.
 LAURA: Fjord, I'm trusting you.
 TRAVIS: If it's too dangerous, we'll stand down. How about that? 
 LAURA: Okay.
 LIAM: Also I have a cat. 
 LAURA: Yeah, it's cute. 
 LIAM: That's not what I mean. If we catch up to them, my cat can follow and I can watch.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, you blanked out there for a second.
 LIAM: If we find them, then we assign Frumpkin to the case and I will lean against a tree. Nott will keep watch over me and we will know where it goes.
 SAM: We're going with them, then?
 LAURA: Yeah, let's follow the direction that the toad went.
 TRAVIS: Yeah.
 MARISHA: Cats love toads.
 LAURA: I like it. It's a good plan. This is definitely not going to backfire. Let's go.
 (laughter) 
 MATT: All right. The horses pick up and begin heading northward towards the Ustaloch.
 LAURA: When we get far away from the carnival, we should drop the guard bodies off. Push them out so it looks like they were on patrol when they turned into zombies. Far away from the carnival.
 MARISHA: We ran into those guards that were patrolling the lake--
 LAURA: Exactly! Like a lake patrol.
 MATT: It doesn't take you too long to get to the southern edge of the Ustaloch. You can see the muddy lake bed that gives way to the water itself. Number of scattered stones in the muck and occasionally you hear the lapping of waves. The very subtle wind flowing through in the night. It's about two in the morning. There's some moonlight in the sky. It looks like a waxing moon. At least the one you can see because there are multiple moons. 
 SAM: Wait, what?
 MATT: There's two moons in Exandria. 
 SAM: How did we never know that? 
 MATT: That was established in the last campaign.
 TALIESIN: Like dogs, we never looked up.
 SAM: How many suns are there?
 MATT: There's one. Anyway, there's a faint bit of moonlight which gives you folks without darkvision a little bit of detail that you can make out in the vicinity. You come to the lake edge and there's the water.
 TRAVIS: This is the best we can do for them.
 LAURA: Take them out of this wagon! 
 MARISHA: Hang on, hang on. I want to look around. Do I see any guards?
 MATT: Perception check.
 MARISHA: Big dice, don't fail! Natural 20!
 MATT: Okay. Couple things. One: you don't see any guards, but you do see a few hundred feet to the west of you along the edge, you see a boat that is about a hundred feet out on the water. You see two figures that are in the boat. Possibly two fishermen or two guards, but you can't really tell from this distance. From your current visual perspective, you don't see the other end of the lake. It's a pretty decent sized lake, but you can see the very faint bump of a landmass that breaks the horizon of the water.
 MARISHA: Like an island?
 MATT: Like an island, possibly. 
 LAURA: Or a giant toad sitting in the water?
 TALIESIN: That would be a very big toad.
 MARISHA: It's far away on the horizon, the little bump?
 MATT: Yeah, it breaks the water's horizon from here.
 MARISHA: There's two figures on a boat about a hundred yards out.
 LAURA: Can they see us?
 MARISHA: I don't know. It's hard to say. Do they seem distracted? Can I make anything else out?
 TRAVIS: Lamplight on the boat? 
 MATT: There's a faint bit of lantern light that's the only reason you're able to make them out at this distance, but that's as much detail as you can make out. They’re a few hundred feet away from you.
 LAURA: If we can't see them very clearly, they can't see us very clearly. We don't have a light on us.
 TRAVIS: We're going to have to ditch this wagon anyway because we've got tracks.
 SAM: Just change the license plate. No? 
 TRAVIS: Vanity plate? What does it say? 
 SAM: Back in time? 
 (laughter)
 MATT: What do you do?
 LAURA: Go up a little further away from the boat and then dump the bodies.
 SAM: It's really shallow. Shouldn't we weigh them down with something?
 LAURA: It's not like we're trying to hide the bodies. We're saying they turned into zombies around here. Is that stupid?
 TRAVIS: No, they don't have to go in the water, right? They're burned. It's not like they burned in the water.
 MATT: That would be very confusing. 
 TRAVIS: It would.
 TALIESIN: The wagon tracks directly to the point at which they are found.
 TRAVIS: That's what I just said.
 LAURA: Oh, coming from the carnival.
 SAM: We could write a little note and put it in one of their pockets that says something like “I've discovered that Caleb and Nott are innocent and should be cleared of all charges”, or something like that.
 LAURA: That would definitely work. Will you add my name to that list?
 SAM: Sure. How do you spell Jester?
 LAURA: Like normal.
 SAM: Okay.
 MARISHA: Maybe we can dump them, backtrack with the cart, and drop the cart back off.
 TRAVIS: As we've been riding, have we seen any tracks that we think might have belonged to the toad? Since it was leaping in these huge arcs.
 MATT: Make a survival check.
 TRAVIS: Ugh, three.
 MATT: Even with your darkvision, it's hard to make out too many details. There's a lot of foot traffic along the banks of the river at different points in the day. There's not a lot of light. You're unable to pick up any tracks.
 LAURA: Maybe we dump the bodies and I'll get out and try to make the tracks go away for a little bit. I'll walk up the path and do like this. 
 TRAVIS: Why? We could get rid of the wagon later. 
 LAURA: Yeah, but the wagon will come from the carnival straight to the bodies. Isn't that weird? 
 LIAM: You'd have to erase the tracks all the way back to the-- how far back are you willing to go?
 LAURA: Not that far.
 LIAM: What's the plan here? Are we going to flee?
 LAURA: I think we have to go back to the inn, right?
 TRAVIS: Once the sun comes up--
 LIAM: I know. Everybody's in deep shit. I understand the problem, but my question is are we cutting and running?
 LAURA: Yeah.
 LIAM: No, I mean cutting and running.
 TRAVIS: No, no, we can't just leave.
 LAURA: Oh, okay.
 LIAM: We do it all the time.
 LAURA: Well... 
 TRAVIS: Let's see if we can find the toad. If the sun starts to break, then we'll make up our mind.
 LAURA: All right. Are we dumping these bodies or what?
 TRAVIS: Yes, kick them out. 
 MATT: Okay, so you remove the bodies from the cart. Are you dumping them on the shoreline?
 LAURA: Yeah. 
 MATT: Okay. (thud, thud) The two transformed guard corpses now lie there. One an ashy mess, the other in three pieces. Left along the bank of the water.
 LAURA: I get out and I start positioning them like maybe they were having a romantic tryst.
 LIAM: Those two burnt men? Yes.
 MATT: Okay. (laughs)
 MARISHA: I'm going to help Jester try and clear the tracks while she positions bodies.
 MATT: Make a survival check.
 MARISHA: (disgusted noise) Eight.
 MATT: All right. You guys-- 
 (laughter)
 TRAVIS: Anybody else want to look for some toad prints?
 LAURA: Do you want us to?
 SAM: We were going to go along the north way, right? 
 TRAVIS: We've been doing that already. 
 MARISHA: If we try and cover the wagon tracks as much as we can, then follow the embankment and try and ride the horses and the cart along the water, it'll hide our tracks as we move northward. 
 LAURA: Sure, let's do that.
 MARISHA: Okay.
 TALIESIN: Who are you?
 TRAVIS: That's actually a great idea.
 TALIESIN: That's really clever. Why would you even think that? 
 LAURA: Oh, she's all about shady shit. She does a lot of it.
 TALIESIN: Huh.
 MARISHA: You understand.
 TALIESIN: Maybe. I don't know. I'll think about it.
 LAURA: (singsong) Go to sleep, little tiefling.
 TALIESIN: Ow, that hurts. Ow.
 LIAM: Beauregard, are the people on the boat doing anything different?
 MATT: You glance back over and you can see the boat seems to have moved a little bit further away and has come up to the bank and looks like it's hitting land.
 MARISHA: Towards us?
 MATT: No, a little bit further away and then has hit the land. The figures are currently taking things out of the boat.
 LAURA: They're late night fishermen.
 MARISHA: I think they're fishermen. Let's keep moving.
 MATT: Okay, which direction are you moving?
 MARISHA: North.
 MATT: Well, north is into the water. Like you hit the water of the bottom of the lake.
 SAM: The toad went due north? Like straight into the water?
 MATT: That's the direction it was traveling. 
 LAURA: Can I look for toad tracks?
 MATT: Make a survival check, sure.
 TRAVIS: Come on, don't roll Sam's fucking dice.
 LAURA: I didn't.
 MATT: Oh, Sam.
 TALIESIN: That was a lot. 
 LAURA: That was a whole lot of rolls. Survival. 11.
 MATT: 11. It's hard to really make out what tracks are what. You do see a few heavy impacts in the mud. Some of them looks like it could have been the bodies being rolled, but not too far from where you are, there's one big smack in the mud. Like something heavy impacted.
 LAURA: Fjord! Come look at this! This is definitely toad tracks.
 TRAVIS: In the shape that it's in, this print. Are their toes pointing in a specific direction?
 MATT: Make an investigation check.
 TALIESIN: Well, this will break my short rest.
 MATT: This will break your short rest.
 TRAVIS: 14.
 MATT: You can see the heavy impact has a few subtler imprints. There do appear to be two hands and two feet though the water has washed in and gotten rid of a lot of the details at this point. You can vaguely tell they appear to be facing towards the water.
 LAURA: That lump is the toad.
 SAM: Could be.
 TALIESIN: How many people in the boat?
 TRAVIS: Two.
 TALIESIN: How many people are we looking for?
 TRAVIS: One and a giant toad.
 TALIESIN: Didn't he leave with a--
 TRAVIS: Girl.
 TALIESIN: Two people?
 MATT: Two people in the boat.
 MARISHA: Do these silhouettes look proportionate to each other?
 MATT: They look proportionate to each other.
 TRAVIS: Does one look like Gorilla Grodd and---
 MATT: They both look vaguely humanoid and regular.
 MARISHA: Which way do the fisherman go?
 MATT: They are a little bit to the west along the bank in the direction of the city. The city is northwest of you currently. If you were to continue around the lake--
 LIAM: Because the city is on the lake so we're just around the edge of the lake.
 MATT: Exactly.
 MARISHA: I think we should keep heading away from the city, right?
 LIAM: It depends on what we’re going to do.
 SAM: If we're chasing the toad it seems like we need to find a boat and go out into the water.
 LAURA: So we head towards that boat that hit land.
 SAM: Steal that boat?
 LAURA: If we go towards the toad we are going to fight the toad.
 SAM: Well no, we are just going to find the toad. You said this. We're camping and waiting and resting.
 LIAM: The other thing we can do, but it will take some time, need about an hour. Frumpkin is a cat but Frumpkin does not need to be a cat. I could fly him over as well but I need time, I need about an hour.
 SAM: Or swim.
 TALIESIN: I'm actively tracking this creature, aren't I on a certain level?
 MATT: I mean, if you want to. You haven't yet decided to.
 TALIESIN: I hadn't really thought about it. It's something I can in theory do.
 LAURA: Because you used your blood on it?
 TALIESIN: No. This would also break my short rest, wouldn't it?
 MATT: Actually, I'd say for the points of expediency, with the time it has taken you and have these discussion at the edge, it's pushing 2:30 like 3:00 in the morning and both of you have finished the short rest.
 TALIESIN: I'm going to use Hunter's Bane really quickly and look at the track for a second.
 MATT: You get your blood maledict and you can use your hit dice if you want.
 TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to do both of those.
 LIAM: I changed my mind, I believe I used arcane recovery during the day. So forget it.
 MATT: Yeah, it's gone.
`
SAM: You can hit dice it.
 LAURA: I bet you have a thing where you can click it on.
 TALIESIN: Now I’m at 12 hit points.
 MATT: That's better, there you go. 
 TRAVIS: 12?
 MATT: Better than one.
 TALIESIN: Yay 12 hit points. I'm going to see if I can help with the tracking because I'm going to start actively tracking this particular creature.
 MATT: Make a survival check. 
 TALIESIN: Survival check? Which I have advantage on.
 MATT: You have advantage on it because it's a feat. 
 TALIESIN: 18.
 MATT: Looking at the imprint you follow back the direction of the carnival and you can see the path because it was a beeline toward the Ustaloch. The best you can tell because the water picks up there's no trail to pick up in the water. Looking at the trajectory, it was very intently making its way towards the water either avoiding making any more tracks and making it difficult to follow.
 TALIESIN: Guy went into the water.
 LAURA: That's what we figured.
 TALIESIN: Do you think he's trying to swim all the way to the other side or you think he's just going around the lake?
 TRAVIS: We're not lucky enough to have any small boats along the shores that have been beached?
 MATT: Not near you. There's the one that you saw the two fishermen are at right now. Then further into the city the docks, there's plenty of boats that are tied up and locked.
 LIAM: At the level two-- Oh sorry, go ahead.
 MARISHA: Go ahead.
 LIAM: It's a rules question, you go for it.
 MARISHA: Even if we find this thing, if we rest camping out then we're not at the tavern.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, we got like four hours till sunrise.
 SAM: Do any of us know what's beyond? like what's on the other side of this lake? Is it a mountain?
 LAURA: Straight across.
 MATT: The other side of the lake from what you know because you were traveling southward towards it, there's no major landmass on the other side of the lake it's just open field. You notice what looks to be some sort of a bulge in the landmass in the center. Too large to be the toad, but it does seem to break up water horizon from that vantage point.
 LAURA: It could have gone to the island.
 MARISHA: I bet that's exactly where it is.
 TRAVIS: How do we feel about the knowledge that it's somewhere here in the lake, perhaps, or the other side? Circling back tomorrow? At least we'll avoid suspicion if we're at the inn.
 LAURA: Maybe keep tracking it? After you sleep?
 TALIESIN: I don't know. I'm not sure. Maybe. Could be.
 MATT: It's not like a mental tracking ability. It's to be able to see details of the specific type of track.
 TALIESIN: I legitimately do not know how it works. Sorry.
 MATT: Just like any other tracking, you still need to have things to follow. You can read damage in the forest to see if something barreled through. You can follow tracks. You can see blood splatters. Anything that can give you an idea of where something went that is one of those types of creatures.
 TALIESIN: Do I know what he was?
 LAURA: He was a fiend.
 MATT: With the knowledge of it being a fiend go ahead and make a religion check.
 TALIESIN: I get advantage on that.
 MATT: You do, actually.
 TALIESIN: Religion check? 15.
 MATT: Now that they've mentioned a fiend, it seems familiar but you only get a memory, you don't know where it came from, of horrible toad-like demonic creatures that exist to the far east in Xhorhas. That's as much as you can recall. You're now sitting here with this memory that comes to mind going, "This whole time!"
 TALIESIN: This whole time I've been sitting with this.
 LIAM: Rules question. Caleb is too fucking poor to change Frumpkin's shape willy-nilly because it's ten gold pieces worth of charcoal, incense, and herbs, which I don't have. So he's a cat for the foreseeable future.
 SAM: Do you just need ten gold pieces?
 LIAM: I need incense, herbs, and charcoal.
 TALIESIN: Are you saying this out loud?
 LIAM: No, I'm just talking in my accent to you.
 TALIESIN: I reach in. I've got some incense.
 LIAM: Do you have charcoal?
 TRAVIS: I'm sure we can find some charcoal.
 TALIESIN: Isn't this impressive enough that I have some incense?
 LIAM: If we can get back into town somehow.
 SAM: We're going to go shopping at three in the morning.
 MATT: Technically, elements of that guard's body are charcoal now.
 MARISHA: Let's go back and raid the fire.
 TALIESIN: There'd also be a fire inside the inn, to be fair. It's not like charcoal is hard to get.
 TRAVIS: You two seem to be able to move freely without suspicion.
 TALIESIN: That's true, you can go shopping more.
 LIAM: I will.
 TALIESIN: Let's go maintain the illusion of innocence for the evening.
 MARISHA: Should we walk the cart off?
 LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 TRAVIS: Leave it outside of town. Maybe give the horse a little spank on the ass and send it on its way.
 MARISHA: See where it goes. I like that.
 TRAVIS: Shall we?
 SAM: The twins.
 LAURA: It's open 24 hours.
 LIAM: That random book about fiends has all answers about the fiend we're chasing. Let's go get it.
 LAURA: You should do that.
 TALIESIN: Xhorhas. It is a creature from Xhorhas. I'm pretty sure, I don't know. God, I'm remembering something.
 LAURA: Let's go.
 TRAVIS: We head back.
 MARISHA: We go along the lake, then off to edge, then we're going to give the horse a slap and send him off.
 MATT: The two fishermen you see are in the process of tying up nets and bags of things and they just stop and watch you guys ride by then go about the rest of their work. You continue with the cart, pulling it up toward the southern edge where the Ustaloch meets Trostenwald. You can abandon it there or you want to send it somewhere?
 LAURA: I don't think we would have taken the cart past the fishermen. Are we going to do that?
 TRAVIS: We're going to head back to the village, to a good distance.
 LIAM: How much ground did we cover? 
 
MATT: So what are you doing?
 TRAVIS: We're taking the cart back to a distance from the city.
 LIAM: Half mile.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, and then letting the horses run and so they send the track off.
 MATT: I see. 
 LAURA: I don’t think we would have gone right past the fishermen where they’d be able to identify us.
 MARISHA: Using the lake to hide tracks.
 MATT: You guys head the opposite direction for a little ways after the field. Who can spooking the horses?
 LIAM: That's your specialty.
 MARISHA: Whack with the stick.
 MATT: Make an animal handling check.
 TRAVIS: If there is any justice in the world.
 MARISHA: It's not great, thanks Travis. Six.
 SAM: Six? To hit a horse? 
 MARISHA: Correctly hit a horse!
 LAURA: The horse whimpers; you hurt a horse.
 MATT: What's your armor class?
 MARISHA: 17.
 MATT: 17? As soon as you hit it, there's a (whinny) and there's a split second where watch its back leg muscle twitch and you duck out of the way as its back hooves (whoosh) past your face.
 TALIESIN: I'm going to walk over to the horses and they're trained horses. 
 MATT: Yeah.
 TALIESIN: I'm going to go whisper in their ear and give them a little pat.
 MATT: Make an animal handling check.
 LAURA: You rolled shit, too!
 TALIESIN: Nine.
 TRAVIS: Horses are our new door!
 TALIESIN: I didn't get advantage because I knew the animals, did I?
 MATT: No. You knew the animals, but you weren't the animal handler.
 LAURA: I use Thaumaturgy and I make the sound of like a predator behind them.
 MATT: Okay. I'll give you an animal handling check with an advantage because it's fun.
 TALIESIN: I'm into this.
 LAURA: Okay, 13! 
 MATT: 13! It's above a ten, guys! Awesome!
 ALL: (chanting) Level two!
 TALIESIN: This is Romper Room!
 MATT: Yeah, I know! With a crack, and a heavy echoing snarling sound in the vicinity, both horses kick up and go into a full gallop spring away from the direction of you. The cart being dragged behind it. They continue to go into the shadow, you don't know how long they are going to go.
 LIAM: I cast Thaumaturgy! (quacks)
 MATT: By the time you guys make it back to the inn--
 LAURA: Those ducks are scary!
 MATT: Are you guys being careful, or are you just walking back?
 LAURA: We're being careful.
 MATT: I'd like you all to roll a stealth check, please.
 TRAVIS: I'm going to use Mask of Many Faces to make myself look old.
 TALIESIN: Natural 20.
 SAM: What was that? I don't even know what that was. 
 TALIESIN: Look at all that stuff!
 LAURA: Does anybody have shitty stealth?
 TALIESIN: I'm can't even see myself with this roll.
 LIAM: I do, but I rolled 12.
 LAURA: Well okay, I was going to give anybody advantage, but here you go.
 SAM: Thank you.
 LAURA: Wow, that was bad.
 LIAM: You have advantage, right? Roll again!
 SAM: I already rolled once.
 TRAVIS: 18, but I'm also--
 LIAM: 16.
 MARISHA: 17.
 LAURA: 18.
 TALIESIN: Technically, my stealth would be 23.
 SAM: 11.
 MATT: All right, that's fine. You manage to make it to the Nestled Nook Inn without any prying eyes seeing too deeply into your movement. You get back to your rooms as the very faint distant change of black night begins to turn to the faintest of blue of morning curling over. You guys go to your respective rooms, and you take a rest?
 LAURA: We should go to sleep.
 LIAM: I'm going to dig some charcoal out of the remains of the fire in the common room and then go to bed.
 MATT: Okay. The owner watches you do that and she's just whatever.
 LIAM: Don't thank me. Lovely inn. Good night.
 MATT: Don't get anything else dirty!
 LIAM: Just going to draw some dicks!
 MATT: You guys complete a long rest.
 TRAVIS: We made it! 
 SAM: One day down. Two days down!
 LAURA: Do we reset our max hit points when we take a long rest?
 MATT: Your max hit points? I mean, your max hit points are your max hit points. 
 TALIESIN: It will auto reset when you long rest.
 SAM: With DandD Beyond, it does the work for you.
 LIAM: Wait, is there a rest button?
 SAM: There is, there are two rest buttons.
 LIAM: Where are they?
 SAM: They are down towards the bottom, short rest or long rest.
 LAURA: I fell asleep in my sketchbook, halfway through my drawing of the two zombie guards making out.
 SAM: Gross. Were they dead?
 LAURA: They're zombies, so yeah!
 TALIESIN: Slightly hotter, okay. 
 LAURA: One arm is like off to the side.
 TALIESIN: Way hotter.
 MATT: With full rests completed, consciousness comes to on the outside of Jester's room with the heavy sound of (knocking). 
 MARISHA: Jester!
 LAURA: Is that our door?
 MARISHA: I think so.
 LAURA: Hold on, I'm naked!
 MARISHA: Yeah, hold on, she's naked! Do you want to get it? Or should I get it?
 LAURA: I'll get it!
 MARISHA: Maybe I should get it.
 LAURA: No, I get up, I get it. Hello!
 MATT: You open the door. The same two crownsguard that had come the day before.
 LAURA: Did you come back to play some games?
 MATT: No. We came back to tell you that you'll be needed for the investigation and questioning within the next three hours to arrive at the behest of the Lawmaster at the stockades.
 MARISHA: Why didn't you just come and get us when you were ready for us?
 LAURA: Well, you know, we might want to brush our teeth.
 MARISHA: Does that take you three hours?
 LAURA: Now we have time to--
 MATT: We'll be back in three hours.
 LAURA: Okay. I'll see you soon! I miss you already!
 MATT: (door creaking) Habit of creeping on guards, I like it. The rest of you come to consciousness. You're rested. At this point in time, it's afternoon. It's about two in the afternoon. 
 TRAVIS: No knock on our door, only you two.
 MATT: It's these two currently, for the moment. Then-- (knocking)
 TRAVIS: Your jury summons is (groans).
 MATT: He's finishing up with them.
 LAURA: It's two o'clock in the afternoon, you said? When we woke up?!
 MATT: Yes.
 LIAM: We got back in the middle of the night. No real job here.
 TRAVIS: I'll open the door.
 MATT: Two guards are there.
 TRAVIS: Yes?
 MATT: Sorry to disturb, the investigation will require you in about three hours. 
 TRAVIS: I just shut the door.
 MARISHA: Love it! It's my favorite. I was waiting for it. 
 MATT: What are you guys doing?
 SAM: Go down for breakfast?
 LIAM: I go down. It's Yorda who runs the place?
 MATT: Correct.
 LIAM: I find Yorda. Excuse me, a question about the town. 
 MATT: She's right in the middle a drink, she's like "Right! What do you need?"
 LIAM: Is there a pawn shop anywhere in this city?
 MATT: "If you're looking for strange wares in general, then you're best look would be Burnished Bibelot."
 LIAM: Thank you.
 MATT: "You might be able to talk to, let's see here, Lochward General might be interested in buying a few things."
 LIAM: Wockwurt?
 MATT: Lochward General.
 LIAM: Lochward's General, of course. Excuse me. That's in the Lochward, then? 
 MATT: Aye, it's about three blocks up north.
 LIAM: Only been here two days. Okay, you are down here?
 SAM: I'm always with you.
 LIAM: Yeah, okay. That flask. 
 SAM: Yes? You saw that?
 LIAM: Yes, I did see it.
 SAM: Sorry!
 LIAM: No, I'm not sorry at all, but I have a big favor to ask you. That's very valuable what you have there. Do you know that is made of platinum?
 SAM: Would I know that it's made of platinum, just from glancing at it and feeling it?
 MATT: It looks very pretty. Make an intelligence check.
 SAM: Not great. Just an intelligence check.
 MATT: Yes, just your modifier.
 SAM: Eight.
 MATT: It's very shiny. 
 LIAM: Let me explain it to you. That little bottle is worth a great deal. It can buy you many full bottles.
 SAM: I don't want to get rid of it. 
 LIAM: Would you like to trade that for many bottle of booze? Many.
 SAM: That is a tough decision. But this is the only one I have! I only have one flask. 
 LIAM: We could buy you another flask that can hold whiskey just as well as that one. Here's the thing, you know that I was very interested in those books. We came here for books and booze. You've gotten a little booze, but we can get a lot and those books are expensive and I know that we can get enough money for it and I really don't feel like pushing our luck with the law here in town and pulling a fast one again.
 SAM: Oh, but it's so pretty. How about this for a counteroffer? How much are the books?
 LIAM: They were worth a total of 13 gold.
 SAM: Here!
 LIAM: Did you just hand me 13 gold?
 MATT: Yes.
 SAM: I like this better.
 (laughter)
 LIAM: I take her but the head and I rustle our heads together.
 SAM: Stop!
 LIAM: That's a good deal. I leave to find that place.
 SAM: I come with him.
 LIAM: Oh, you're coming too? What a good day this is! All right, let's go shopping!
 MATT: All right, you make your way to Burnished Bibelot. It is open, though there is nobody currently inside the interior. As you go to the door, it opens up and you see the same cluttered mess of the inside. There across the way you see the tiny gnome gentleman who’s up on top of his desk, his legs folded over each other. He’s looking through a book right now, as he’s thumbing through, “Oh, hello!”
 LIAM: Hello there, my friend! Just as I said, I’ve returned. I have what we agreed on. 13 gold for these two books that we discussed.
 MATT: “Yes! Okay. Good! I have them right here!” He reaches back and then has to arrange himself again.
 TRAVIS: And dies.
 LIAM: Free books!
 MARISHA: The best day ever!
 MATT: Eventually he crawls off the top of the desk, gets down there, puts the two books on the top. “Wonderful doing business with you!” Slides them forward to you, counts--
 LIAM: These are the same two books? As yesterday?
 MATT: “Those are the ones you told me to hold for you, yes.”
 LIAM: Oh, I was asking Matthew, these are the same two books?
 MATT: Yes they are.
 LIAM: Oh good! Excellent!
 SAM: Your accent is confusing.
 LAURA: I know it’s confusing when you say things in the accent all the time!
 LIAM: I never stopped with the British either last time so I’m never going to stop now. Oh, I’m so happy, and I’m saying this out loud as Caleb. Good day to you!
 SAM: So you don’t want to--
 LIAM: I scoop up Nott and I just start dancing down the street with her up onto my shoulders!
 SAM: Sure you don’t want stay here and shop around some more? Okay!
 LIAM: No! We have plans to make with our new friends! Let’s go get some breakfast!
 SAM: Okay, but I could’ve perused some of the aisles and it’s a long-- okay!
 LIAM: Nope! We’re away!
 TRAVIS: No hands in your pockets order.
 MATT: You guys make your way back as the rest of you have come to consciousness and you’ve head down to the tavern.
 LAURA: Cool. Why are you guys so happy?
 LIAM: Good shopping run. Where did you get 13 gold?
 SAM: I’ve always had it, you ever asked for any.
 LIAM: Good to know. I don’t need to know anything more, I’m just happy that you have it. I’m thankful.
 SAM: I collect things, among them are small pieces of gold. I have more.
 LIAM: I just squeeze the cheeks, and I look at my books!
 SAM: Ooh! You made my cheeks all green!
 MATT: So, it’ll take you a few hours to go through those books.
 LIAM: Yes. I will start on the one about fiends because it is topical!
 MATT: You begin to read through it. In the tavern at the table, or do you want to read in your room? Up to you.
 LIAM: No I’m going to read here. Good focus!
 LAURA: Can I look at one of your books?
 LIAM: Yeah, go away.
 LAURA: Is that a yes? You said yes.
 LIAM: I shove the book deep into my belt near my dick so she doesn’t want to go near it!
 LAURA: I’m not afraid of dicks.
 MARISHA: She’s not your sister anymore.
 LIAM: Good point. Hey now.
 SAM: He gets like this when he’s studying. He gets very focused, it’s best not to disturb him.
 MATT: It’s an interesting book. It talks about different forms of fiends and demons and the hierarchy of the Nine Hells. It talks about myths and stories of devils and demons interfering with the lives of mortals. A lot of it is fables, a lot of it is warnings and things that parents would tell to keep their children from wandering in the darkness. But it does have little tidbits of information about different types, and they talk about horned devils, and they talk about the great and terrible balor and pit fiend, and it seems to be a jumble between both demons and devils.
 LAURA: Can I look over his shoulder the whole time he’s reading it?
 MATT: Sure, if he lets you.
 LIAM: I do not let her. I am in a corner.
 TRAVIS: And it’s about 2:30 to 3:00?
 MATT: Right now, it’s about three.
 TRAVIS: In the next couple hours they said they would called for us.
 MATT: Yes.
 SAM: Should we go look for the toad?
 TRAVIS: I was going to say, did they come to your room as well?
 LAURA: Yeah. In a couple hours.
 MARISHA: Should we talk about what we’re going to say to them? Do we need to corroborate our stories?
 TRAVIS: I mean we tell the truth, we did nothing wrong.
 LAURA: That’s right, we were in this inn the whole time.
 MARISHA: That’s true. Yeah.
 TRAVIS: I was thinking that if we get out of there tonight, fingers crossed, we should probably think about acquiring some sort of vessel to explore the lake tonight.
 LAURA: We can definitely steal a boat.
 MARISHA: We know where the fisherman’s boat is.
 TRAVIS: Or I may be able to arrange free passage on a vessel.
 MARISHA: What, how?
 TRAVIS: I have a little knack with, you know.
 LAURA: He was a sailor! That’s how I met him!
 TRAVIS: Well, for a bit.
 MARISHA: Wow, that’s pretty cool.
 LIAM: How long was that for?
 TRAVIS: Few years.
 LAURA: As soon as Caleb looks up, I look in his book. What is your book about?
 LIAM: Oh, this is about grumpkins and periwinkles.
 LAURA: (gasps) Those are my favorite!
 LIAM: What is a periwinkle?
 LAURA: Are there drawings of them?
 LIAM: Occasional drawings. There’s no penises drawn in this book so I don’t think you’d be interested.
 TALIESIN: Any toad creatures?
 MATT: You do find one interesting tidbit of information that piques your interest.
 SAM: Ooh, he has it written down? On a thing?
 TALIESIN: Oh, the first piece of paper of the game!
 MARISHA: What’s it say?
 MATT: If he decides he wants to share, it’s up to him.
 LIAM: Leave me alone, I’m reading.
 MARISHA: Caleb, we’re bored! Tell us a story!
 LIAM: I need 20 actual seconds to see what the piece of paper says!
 TALIESIN: Have you read it now? What’s it say?
 SAM: So Fjord, your very acquainted with seamen then? Having been on the water for so long?
 TRAVIS: Sure am! Yep.
 MARISHA: Have you heard that joke a lot?
 TRAVIS: I have. It gets funnier every time though, I got to say. It’s all in the delivery.
 LAURA: He laughed at it the first twenty times I said it to him.
 MARISHA: So wait, do you seamen have cloisters in Trostenwald?
 SAM: Are there clusters of seamen around you at all times?
 TRAVIS: Is it too early in the campaign to walk away? And I fucking saunter away.
 SAM: And I saunter away. I mosy away.
 MATT: As Fjord slowly walks away from the table, not engaging with your comedic advances.
 LIAM: Do I remember people talking about nightmares from the past couple of days? Not Liam, but Caleb?
 MATT: No, you didn’t inquire or question.
 LIAM: Okay, and I didn’t overhear, okay.
 LAURA: What does it say?
 LIAM: I mean, it’s chock-a-block with a lot of things, most of it probably untrue and stories to scare your children, but there is some sort of demon that is described as being fat and rotund, and it talks about-- I mean, this is too coincidental, it can’t be the thing that we’re-- what are the odds of something being in this book, and it’s what we’re chasing today? But this is describing some sort of scaled demon that feeds on people in the night, when they’re sleeping, and it leaves corrupted, undead corpses behind, known as husks.
 LAURA: That is what they look like. They look like husks!
 MARISHA: They did look like husks.
 TRAVIS: And we didn’t see anybody it fed on.
 LIAM: Does this book-- is it of this town, or?
 MATT: Oh no, it’s a general book about--
 LIAM: General book, could be anywhere.
 MATT: Anywhere, anything, it doesn’t even mention locations. It’s just, “This is some lore about devils and demons!”
 TALIESIN: Kylre’s been around for a while though! And this is new, right? I feel like-- Was there nothing?
 TRAVIS: How well did you know Kylre?
 TALIESIN: I mean, not that well. Of everybody, the least.
 LIAM: You haven’t heard the word Nergaliid?
 TALIESIN: That's a--
 MATT: As soon as he says that, it triggers something in your brain, and that thought you had the other night clicks. Like, that's what it was that escaped you. Nergaliid.
 TALIESIN: I have heard that word before. 
 LIAM: Because that's what I'm talking about here. 
 TALIESIN: Oh dear. Oh, why can't I remember. It was so long ago. 
 MARISHA: Okay, so what was Mr. Frogman's diet? 
 TRAVIS: Yeah, what did he feast on? 
 TALIESIN: What did he eat? 
 MATT: He ate what was given to him. 
 TALIESIN: He ate what we had!
 MATT: He seemed like a lizard man, from what you knew and experienced. He thought it was fine. There was no draw to it. 
 LAURA: You never noticed him eating people before? 
 TALIESIN: I feel like I would've taken note of it. I don't necessarily know I would've commented on it, but I would've noted it.
 LAURA: Okay. 
 TALIESIN: And it was not noted. 
 LIAM: Once again, I have no idea if this is the creature that we're in pursuit of, but this talks about it not eating food, but siphoning the life off of mortal creatures, but not to the point of death or harming them. They might not even notice that it’s happening.
 TALIESIN: Oh no.
 LAURA: (gasps) That's what was happening to Toya. Maybe all of you.
 LIAM: It says that this thing has two types of feeding: one is slow and unnoticeable, maybe, and one is quick with much pain and anguish.
 LAURA: Does it say anything about it hiding in water?
 LIAM: No.
 LAURA: Does it say anything about it liking the sound of song?
 LIAM: It does not.
 LAURA: Is it related at all to the periwinkles you were talking about before?
 TALIESIN: It’s not possible he’s trying to head back to Xhorhas, is it? I said out loud.
 TRAVIS: I think we saw both of the fast and the slow feeding methods.
 TALIESIN: Kylre was not a talker.
 LAURA: Does it say how to kill it?
 TRAVIS: Yeah, weaknesses? Vulnerabilities?
 TALIESIN: Stabbing?
 LAURA: Well, most fiends are weak to holy damage, right?
 MATT: Make a religion check.
 TALIESIN: Can I also do this? I'm thinking about everything I hear.
 MATT: Sure, I'll let you roll for it.
 SAM: They have a vulnerability to poppyseed muffins.
 TALIESIN: Nine.
 LAURA: 14
 MATT: You don't get the idea that most devils or demons have a vulnerability to radiant or holy damage. Some might, some don't, but you were unable to take a beat on this. The book you have is informative from an encyclopedic standpoint. It's sort of storytelling and an informative thing, but it's not a catalog about all the aspects and details of each creature.
 LIAM: Right, it's a kid's Encyclopedia Britannica and scanning through, I saw one thing that popped out.
 MATT: Yeah, you were like, wait.
 LIAM: May I ask with my intelligence score of 18 and the Keen Mind feat, could we say that Caleb is a speed reader?
 MATT: In comparison to some, maybe. You're not Johnny Five-style, I know kung-fu.
 LIAM: Believably, not magic.
 MATT: Yeah, you can read pretty quick, let's say. You spend a lot of time by yourself reading.
 LAURA: “Reading.”
 LIAM: Good times.
 TRAVIS: In the bathroom.
 TALIESIN: Clusters of semen all around you.
 LIAM: It was still funny when it was just implied. You can paint it across the wall.
 TALIESIN: Always funny. Always.
 LIAM: We're talking about masturbation.
 SAM: Jerking off.
 (laughter)
 LIAM: Would you say that Caleb is a speed-beater?
 SAM: Roll for spanking.
 MATT: From the window to the wall.
 (laughter and groaning)
 MATT: As you guys are having this discussion, the two guards that had come in earlier come through the main door earlier than the three hours you had anticipated with another guard in tow. As they rush in they glance around the room and see you and make a beeline to your table in a very huff bit of energy. They say, "You are absolved of meeting this afternoon. We'll pick this up tomorrow."
 LAURA: What's going on?
 TALIESIN: Wait, what?
 MATT: "There have been a series of murders within the Crownsguard that we are investigating as well. This will be part of the investigation tomorrow, you are not to leave this inn."
 LAURA: We could help. Obviously, we had nothing to do with it if people are hurt outside and we were here the whole time.
 MARISHA: How are we absolved yet we still have to be locked in this inn?
 MATT: "You are absolved of it today. We're still going to come by tomorrow and have you questioned. We've arrested Ornna and we have members of the carnival that have fled that we're currently seeking at the moment."
 MARISHA: You should pick better words next time that are slightly more clear.
 MATT: "We'll return tomorrow." They leave in a frustrated huff.
 TRAVIS: Well, our day just got freed up.
 SAM: But they still said we couldn't leave.
 TALIESIN: You could read that other book, at the very least.
 LIAM: I could. I could also-- here's the thing about my cat. He's a cat, definitely a cat, but is also a fey creature. If I have an hour, he doesn't have to be a cat. He can temporarily be a bird.
 LAURA: How much did you say it costs, though?
 LIAM: Well, I have a lot of charcoal now, and you said you have incense on you?
 TALIESIN: I go into my bag and I've got some old, weird-- I've got a weird, little--
 MATT: You've got about eight silvers worth of incense, and that's a lot.
 TALIESIN: It's in a very strange, ornate bag that's covered in strange gems and weird filigree.
 SAM: Does Molly always smell of patchouli?
 TALIESIN: Sandalwood. It's nag champa all over.
 MATT: It's masking the faint scent of horse dung.
 SAM: What else do you need?
 TRAVIS: Are you sure you want to do this, with your cat?
 LIAM: Yes. I prefer him as a cat, to be honest, but in a pinch.
 TRAVIS: Anything else besides a bird? I mean, any kind of creature?
 LIAM: Well not any kind of creature, but I've made him an octopus once. There was this one time when Nott was very high up in a burning building and we had no way to get her down.
 SAM: I jumped on to the octopus and it served as some sort of a landing pad. It killed the octopus, but I lived.
 LAURA: Octopuses are very smart.
 LIAM: I think it's octopi.
 LAURA: I didn't say I was very smart.
 TALIESIN: Enough about the pastries already.
 TRAVIS: It can be killed is an important thing to know. I only mean that if it's important to you, in a moment of danger I would try to save it, but if that's not important.
 LIAM: It can be pricey to keep bringing him back and all that, but he-- no you can't kill him.
 SAM: I’ve tried.
 LIAM: She's eaten him twice. I will need about an hour of time I'll probably head upstairs. Do you have a pot I can borrow?
 MATT: Yorda is currently in the process of sitting down and checking something underneath and bar and goes, "I'm sorry what was that?"
 LIAM: I was hoping you had an iron pot I could borrow for-- never mind I'll use the piss pot. I'll borrow this.
 TALIESIN: Yes, of course.
 LIAM: Is this enough to jury-rig?
 MATT: How much is the--
 LIAM: It's ten gold.
 MATT: No, you're going to need to go out and buy some.
 LIAM: That's why I asked.
 SAM: Buy some, what, incense?
 LIAM: Okay, this is a joke. I need to actually go to the incense store.
 LAURA: Get ten gold of charcoal and incense?
 LIAM: For this plan to work.
 MATT: There is the remedy store that you've seen before, and that would be the place to have incense and/or herbal type.
 SAM: I've been to one of these places, it's called Natural Remedies. Herbs and medicinal things. It's up the street a bit.
 LIAM: Do you have ten gold?
 SAM: Maybe.
 TRAVIS: I have ten gold.
 LAURA: You're going through gold very quickly.
 SAM: Or I can sneak in and grab it for you.
 LAURA: I could help you.
 SAM: That sounds fun.
 LIAM: We're still trouble with the law. I don't want to push that. If we have the gold, that's the safest path.
 TALIESIN: I'm in for a penny. I'm going to through a gold in there as well.
 MATT: All right, so you have ten gold between you: nine from Fjord, and one from Molly.
 LAURA: Okay, I'll put one in then you have only eight.
 MATT: Okay, so eight off. All right, you have the gold. We'll say for the purposes of expediency, it's easy enough to go purchase the necessary incense and it's quite a bit. For the purposes of this ritual, which you've done before, it's quite a cluster you have to assemble for this. The chalk's amassed, the other materials you need for it.
 TALIESIN: I just saw Jester open her purse. Dear--!
 LIAM: I'm going to go up to my room and it takes me an hour to do this. An hour and ten minutes to be exact. I put the--
 TALIESIN: The ten minutes is clean-up.
 (laughter)
 LIAM: Look at the dungeon master. Is that maybe the longest facepalm?
 MATT: I don't know, you guys have made me facepalm pretty long before.
 LIAM: I go upstairs to cast Find Familiar.
 MARISHA: Oh, you found him!
 MATT: What form?
 LIAM: A sparrow.
 MATT: As you finish the concentration, the cat form shimmers and condenses into this tiny little cluster of coal before it sprouts wings and you glance on your shoulder. (whistles)
 LIAM: I'm sorry, I know this is not your preferred form, but it is only temporary until I get ten more gold. Let's go down and get some breakfast.
 MATT: You guys, after waiting patiently and talking amongst yourselves, Caleb reemerges with a tiny sparrow.
 LIAM: There he is. He lands on Molly's horn.
 LAURA: Damn it. Right here?
 LIAM: On his horn, yes.
 TALIESIN: Go ahead.
 LAURA: This is the lumpiest little bird I've ever seen.
 MARISHA: Is his name still Frumpkin, it's just a bird now?
 LIAM: Always Frumpkin, yeah.
 TALIESIN: He's a little feathery Frumpkin.
 LIAM: He flits over to Jester's horn. Takes a dump.
 LAURA: I feel so special and blessed you guys.
 TALIESIN: You look like a princess.
 LAURA: Thank you.
 LIAM: He stays there for the time being. Is this what we're doing? I can't go anywhere, I'm going to be blind and deaf, I have to stay still and safe. Try not hit me in the head with too many things. It'll take a while, but he will go off. 
 TRAVIS: Well if you'd like you could stay at the inn, or we could acquire that boat and once you're on board we could send it out as a sort of a recon.
 LIAM: That's true as well.
 SAM: Do sparrows see in the dark? They're daytime birds.
 TRAVIS: It is daytime right now, it would require us leaving now.
 SAM: We should do this quickly before the light goes away right?
 TALIESIN: Well if we can send the sparrow out, we can carry him with us if he finds anything.
 LIAM: I could have done a bat, but it's too late for that now.
 TRAVIS: A what?
 LIAM: A bat.
 TRAVIS: We should take advantage of the daytime. Out the windows as we did before?
 TALIESIN: Let's let the sparrow see if it can find anything then we know which direction we have to head into so there's not too much meandering about.
 MARISHA: Yeah, can we hunker down here while--
 TALIESIN: Until there's a direction to go.
 TRAVIS: Perhaps we should go upstairs--
 MATT: You can only see through Frumpkin's eyes for up to a 100-foot radius.
 LIAM: I thought we talked about this. You told me-- and if you need to change it, change it-- But that I could only control him telepathically up to 100 feet, but could continue to see.
 MATT: Let me double-check.
 LIAM: I'm happy with whatever your ruling is, but that's how we've done it.
 MATT: I have to recall the specifics, I may have confused--
 TRAVIS: If that's the case, we'll get the boat. If not we'll let drone sparrow activate.
 LIAM: That's what I based this whole plan on.
 LAURA: Do we have to get in disguise again in order to leave?
 TRAVIS: We could try to sneak out the side of the window. It is daytime.
 LIAM: The wording is a little squirrely.
 MATT: The wording is a little squirrely. Yeah, you cannot communicate with it telepathically, but you could technically still see through its eyes, I suppose.
 LIAM: So I can give him the command up close to go, but if anything happens I can't improvise with him. He does what the command is.
 MATT: Right. What's the command?
 LIAM: To fly north to the island and circle it a few times to see what we can see and come back.
 MATT: All right. As you go up to the window and release Frumpkin--
 TRAVIS: Can we say we're doing this from one of our rooms?
 LIAM: We gather in Fjord and Molly's room.
 MATT: It's curious when Caleb is focusing the pupils go to a very faint sky blue. You see flickering in them, though you cannot make any imagery out of it, it's just the strange movement of the pupil.
 TRAVIS: Yep, there's that bullshit again.
 LAURA: He can't communicate with us when he's like this?
 TRAVIS: He talks. He will talk to you out of the fucking blue.
 LAURA: Can he feel if we touch him? I poke him in the forehead.
 LIAM: Ow.
 LAURA: Oh, okay.
 LIAM: Don't do that please, I'm trying to concentrate.
 LAURA: Can he tell who did it?
 SAM: No, he can't see you.
 LAURA: That's wonderful.
 SAM: But I will tell him later when he asks.
 LAURA: Well, okay, but he won't know now.
 MATT: As you concentrate, the bird's eye view of Trostenwald-- Frumpkin carries up high into the air. For the large lake that it is, you can see two smaller land masses in the center of the lake. Technically not north from where you are now, since you're back in the city, it's more of a northeastern direction. They're both relatively small, one's maybe a few 100 hundred feet across, the other one is maybe 50 feet across. It's a smaller mass. Watching as it coasts downward and does a pass over the larger one, make a perception check for Frumpkin.
 LIAM: That is a six plus very little or nothing, so you can guesstimate.
 MATT: There is a faint treeline on this island. The island has a few small tree, which is mainly what you had seen during the night when you look out over the water, Beauregard. The land mass was actually the very top of this tree line. It's a small grove that has clustered there on the center of this island.Unable to make out any other details other than the tops of these trees and there's a few spots in between where you can see overgrown grass and general ground, rock.
 LIAM: This is the bigger one?
 MATT: The bigger one, yeah. Make a perception check for the smaller one.
 LIAM: Worse. Five.
 MATT: The other one has maybe five or six trees on it, but most of them appear to have either died or be standing alone on this small mass. That one looks pretty barren. Even with as bad of a look that was, it doesn't look like there's anything visible on that land mass.
 LIAM: Does it look balder than the other?
 MATT: It does.
 LIAM: Okay.
 MATT: The larger one has more of a cluster, a grove.
 LIAM: Last question, I can probably tell how far apart these two islands are, yeah?
 MATT: Yeah, they're roughly 600 feet apart from each other.
 LIAM: 600, okay.
 SAM: We're all sitting around in this room, watching him watch TV, essentially.
 MATT: Yes, basically.
 SAM: While this is going on, can I whip out my little chemistry kit and start putting together some chemical stuff?
 MATT: Sure, what would you like to make?
 SAM: Acid.
 MATT: Okay. It requires half a day to make that.
 SAM: I'll start it, then.
 MATT: Okay.
 SAM: Get in an hour of work.
 MATT: Okay.
 MARISHA: While she's doing that, I'll take my staff and repair where it cracked.
 MATT: That's easy enough.
 LAURA: I'm going to braid Caleb's hair.
 MATT: Okay.
 LIAM: I feel that.
 LAURA: I know.
 LIAM: It feels good.
 SAM: We talking just one braid? French braid?
 LAURA: Like a few little braids, because his hair is not super long. Maybe one here, one here, and one down here.
 LIAM: You can't make me Vax again, it won't work.
 MATT: Make an intelligence check, adding your proficiency modifier.
 SAM: One.
 (laughter)
 TRAVIS: You kill us all.
 TALIESIN: Play-Doh, we've got Play-Doh.
 MATT: For the supplies that you've spent-- You've used your one set of acid supplies you had on you, so you'll have to buy more to make it again. As you begin to make it, it becomes caustic and begins to melt through part of your glove. You immediately freak out, you drop it, and it hits the wood. Splatters a bit and begins to melt through the wood.
 SAM: Sorry. I didn't mean to, I was-
 LAURA: (gasps) Now we can spy on the people below us.
 SAM: It didn't go through the entire floor, I don't think.
 TALIESIN: Well we're not going to get our deposit back.
 SAM: We'll move the nightstand over a little to cover it up. No one will see.
 MARISHA: Is it still slowly eating through the wood?
 MATT: It is still slowly eating through the wood.
 SAM: I pour some water on it.
 MARISHA: Oh no.
 TALIESIN: That makes it worse.
 SAM: Oh no.
 MATT: Eventually Frumpkin begins to return, having done Frumpkin's full watch.
 LIAM: When I see that he's halfway back, I come out of it.
 MATT: You come out of it and the first thing you see is all of them gathered around this hole in the wood.
 LIAM: What are you doing?
 SAM: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Caleb.
 LIAM: I plant my hands on the sides of the wood and start transmuting it to iron.
 LAURA: Iron? That's not noticeable.
 MATT: As you concentrate that area and the wood around where that hole all of the sudden begins to turn darker and more solid. While the texture remains of wood, suddenly it has the appearance of a dull reddish-brown metal.
 SAM: Thank you. We'll mop it up with some towels and whatnot while it's still iron.
 LIAM: Hopefully it will dry.
 TRAVIS: That is a hell of a talent you have.
 TALIESIN: It's pretty fancy.
 MARISHA: Is that what you did with the coin? Is this the coin trick?
 SAM: No, the coin was magic. It was a magic pot that we sold you.
 LAURA: Oh man, I've been concentrating on skinky-doodles all day.
 SAM: That is your power word.
 LAURA: All right.
 SAM: Sorry.
 LAURA: It's fine.
 MARISHA and SAM: Sorry.
 LIAM: It brought us closer together.
 SAM: Would you like back the two copper pieces you gave me for the pot?
 LAURA: No, you keep it. I'm a very generous person.
 TRAVIS: Can we ask what you saw?
 LIAM: Of course, sorry. Acid. Wood. There are two islands out there, a bigger one-- they’re not close-- and a smaller one. One is bald-ish, a couple of trees, but I couldn't see too well on either of them. The bigger one is dense with trees. I didn't see them.
 LAURA: Did you have it fly down closer so you could see better?
 LIAM: I thought that he would be able to see from the air, and I thought that would have been safer, so no, I'm sorry.
 TRAVIS: It was a busy water, there was lots of ships out?
 LIAM: I would have seen that.
 MATT: There are some fishing vessels out there, and there are a number of them that are still at the docks.
 TRAVIS: It's not a lull for any reason?
 MATT: No.
 LIAM: It's not fleet week.
 LAURA: I guess we should go to the big island?
 LIAM: I think that the chances of finding it on the big island are greater, yes.
 TRAVIS: Fair enough. Out the window, shall we?
 MARISHA: What time of day is it?
 MATT: By now it's 3:30 in the afternoon, four o'clock.
 LAURA: Should we wait until about dusky-time?
 MARISHA: That's what I was thinking. Wait until the sun starts to go down? Because it's got to be soon at this point.
 MATT: Actually, it's probably closer to five at the time that you've spent with Frumpkin, so it's starting to get closer to dusk.
 LAURA: Okay. Does anybody else want braids in the amount of time we have to wait?
 MARISHA: Ooh, yeah! Can you give me one going back this way?
 LAURA: Of course, I can totally do that.
 MARISHA: Thanks.
 TRAVIS: Is anyone else going to be heading out the front door besides Caleb, Nott, and myself?
 LAURA: I don't want to waste a spell this time.
 TRAVIS: I think that's smart.
 TALIESIN: I'll keep with you.
 LIAM: How far away, roughly, was the edge of the lake and islands from where we are right now?
 MATT: From where you are right now? I'd say a mile and a half.
 LIAM: Okay, so while everyone is preparing, I take out my spool of silver thread and I go first to Jester's room, and I stretch the thread across, and a little (magic flitter sound) flashes across and the thread disappears. It takes about ten minutes each time, and I do the same on Fjord's doorway, stretch across (magic flitter sound). If anyone goes in to these doors besides you, I will know, but not when we're on that island. Only on the way there. Lasts about a mile.
 LAURA: That's awesome!
 TRAVIS: That's great, yeah.
 MARISHA: While we're getting ready, Molly, I don't know if you unintentionally dodged the question last time, or if you didn't hear me, but you never exactly told us how the circus creates and writes their performance acts.
 TALIESIN: I’ve forgotten about that.
 MARISHA: Oh, so you did hear me though?
 TALIESIN: We were in the middle of things.
 MARISHA: Just clarifying.
 TALIESIN: It's usually Gustav. If somebody's got an act, they show it off, Gustav figures out how it's going to work into the narrative. Puts it all together.
 MARISHA: You bring your own narrative?
 TALIESIN: You bring a bit, and then the bit is shaped and formed by the director of the show. If you can do a thing with fire or you can do some juggling, and then they figure out how that's going to work into everything. Where it sits and what costuming, and the whole thing is all an act. Mostly. Mostly an act.
 MARISHA: Did Toya and Kylre come together with their act?
 LAURA: They came separate.
 MARISHA: They came separate.
 TALIESIN: Oh, you're thinking of Toya and Kylre? They were an act before-- They were an act for as long as I can remember, right?
 MATT: As long as you can remember, yeah.
 TALIESIN: Yeah, I've never not known them as an act.
 LAURA: I thought when we talked to them they said that Toya came after Kylre. They joined the circus at separate times.
 MARISHA: That's what they told you?
 SAM: When we were investigating, we were--
 LAURA: We gave them a hard-- what was it?
 SAM: Bad Cop.
 LAURA: Yeah, Good Cop. I was the good cop.
 SAM: I was the bad cop!
 LAURA: Yeah, and we got hard information from them!
 SAM: You're not leaving here without telling us the truth!
 LAURA: Yeah, and I was like, “Don't worry, she won't hurt you!”
 SAM: I'm crazy! I'll bite her too!
 LAURA: Then they just confessed to everything! They were like, "We're a fiend!" and she was like, "I'm a little girl!"
 SAM: Yeah, it was crazy.
 LAURA: That was how it went.
 SAM: She confessed to being a little girl.
 LIAM: Do you have any empty positions at the circus for these two?
 TALIESIN: I'm feeling like maybe that might be a thing.
 LIAM: Tealeaf, you said, "It's mostly an act." What's the not-mostly part?
 TALIESIN: Well, I mean, everyone's got some weird. We're weird people. People come in and you're a bit strange, you got something you can do.
 LIAM: Are they all swashbuckling swordsmen like you?
 TALIESIN: No.
 LAURA: Can they all tell fortunes like you?
 TALIESIN: No.
 SAM: Do they cut themselves like you?
 TALIESIN: Well, that's a complicated conversation, but no.
 MARISHA: You guys are super easy to lie to, no offense or anything. They lied to them, which means--
 LAURA: No, they didn't lie to us!
 SAM: We meted out the truth!
 LAURA: They told us the truth!
 SAM: We cracked the case wide open!
 TALIESIN: She is a little girl, to be fair.
 LIAM: Nott?
 SAM: Toya. Unless, and here's my new theory: The big frog man can leech the life force from people?
 LIAM: If that's what it is, yeah.
 SAM: What if Toya is a fully-grown adult woman, but he's been slowly leeching so much life from her that she's a small husk.
 TALIESIN: Toya's not a fully-grown adult woman.
 SAM: She's a tiny full-grown person!
 TALIESIN: She's a dwarf.
 SAM: Oh, she's just a dwarf? Oh, okay, that makes more sense, actually, when you say it that way. It seemed like she was shrunken down from magic!
 TALIESIN: That is so offensive.
 LIAM: Perhaps this girl Toya is his baby's bottle, and then once in a while he wants an extra snack.
 TALIESIN: I think you're right, but I don't know how he's managed to go this long. Why now, and why in front of all those people?
 LAURA: What if he's like, one of those creatures that live at the bottom of the sea, and she's not actually even a person, she's like this light thing that dangles in front of--
 SAM: One of his tentacles!
 LAURA: Yeah!
 TRAVIS: He has tentacles now.
 SAM: Not just tentacles, dwarf tentacles!
 LIAM: Fucking anime actors.
 (laughter)
 SAM: I think we know all we need to know.
 TALIESIN: I think he is a fiend. I think he is feeding off her. The rest of it I'm not sure.
 MARISHA: You never noticed Toya acting weird? You were never like, "Oh this is a strange--"
 TALIESIN: Have you met us? We're all a bit weird, and you don't ask a ton of questions.
 MARISHA: Yeah, but there's a difference between "quirky" weird and "Oh, I think this person's life force is being siphoned away from them" weird.
 TALIESIN: There is. It's the difference between being in a carnival and not being in a carnival.
 MARISHA: Then why were you with the carnival?
 TALIESIN: Because I'm weird!
 MARISHA: (groaning)
 SAM: That tracks. That definitely tracks.
 TALIESIN: I mean, it's putting together. He was never that talkative. I don’t know. I don't like it.
 LIAM: Well, what are we doing?
 MARISHA: Let's go find the damn toad!
 TRAVIS: Can I use Mask of Many Faces to change into that older gray-haired farmer?
 MATT: Sure. Easy enough. The sun is close to setting. I think you got about another 30 minutes or so before it sets. 
 SAM: Let's go.
 LAURA: I Bless you.
 SAM: Gesundheit. On the way out, can I grab some booze from the bar to fill up my platinum flask? Or to fill it up a little?
 MATT: Okay, we'll say for that, that'll run you about two silver pieces.
 SAM: Great. I'll mark it down.
 MATT: It's a hefty flask, too.
 TRAVIS: Using DandD Beyond.
 MATT: Mark that bar tally. All right. Liquor refilled, you go towards the window, you all gather and glance out, and in the alley below the inn is a stationed crownsguard that wasn't there before. You immediately get the sense that with the sudden murder of two crownsguard being discovered in the vicinity, they may have beefed up security a little bit.
 MARISHA: Oh shit.
 MATT: Only one of them is guarding the alley's exit onto the main street, and they're looking away at the moment onto the road, but occasionally glance over their shoulder into the alley. But there appears to be a little more of a security set-up.
 LAURA: Maybe you should go out the front and talk to him and distract him so we can sneak out the window.
 TRAVIS: I can do that. Do you want to come along on this little escapade?
 LIAM: Yes, I'm a good talker when I have to be.
 SAM: As am I.
 TALIESIN: Well!
 LIAM: Not for this.
 SAM: I'll keep lookout.
 TALIESIN: I am not the right kind of talker for this.
 TRAVIS: Fair enough. So I'll head out the front.
 MATT: Okay, you exit without issue.
 TRAVIS: Can I locate the crownsguard?
 MATT: Easy enough, and as you exit the tavern, you can see where once there were two guards sitting at the front, there's now three, and there are two guards stationed across the street that are keeping a watch. It looks like everyone's on high alert since they've had some of their own crownsguard killed. You make your way around the corner, through the T-intersection to the other road that meets with the main street that crosses in front of the Nestled Nook, and you see the guard stationed outside who's currently leaning up against the wall, arms crossed, looking back and forth.
 TRAVIS: Can I run up to him and say: (old raspy voice) Help, please, over here! I've seen one of those creatures! It's tearing into him and it’s horrible. Please, come quickly!
 MATT: Make a deception check.
 SAM: Oh yes, here it is. Come on charisma.
 TRAVIS: 15.
 MATT: 15? He goes, "Which way? Please, point and show me."
 TRAVIS: This way, quickly, please!
 MATT: He grabs his blade and draws it out, and gives a jog after you. The rest of you guys make your way down quickly outside into the alleyway. Make a stealth check.
 LAURA: I'm so scared of rolling right now.
 TALIESIN: Why does every roll have to be-- Oh thank god.
 SAM: We're fine, we went out the front door.
 MARISHA: Nope, it's a one.
 TALIESIN: 18.
 LAURA: 21.
 SAM: We're going out the front door.
 MATT: All right
 MARISHA: I don't know! You know, if it's binary, one means--
 MATT: All right. Between the three of you making the check that's still a majority success. But you do pop your ankle when you land.
 MARISHA: Did you see the stink-eye he gave me?
 LAURA: Don't make comments after he just was kind to us.
 MATT: I was being kind! You sprained your ankle a little bit as you land and you kind of hop behind but the three of you make your way past the alley without issue.
 SAM: Does she have disadvantage on all checks for the next two days?
 MATT: No.
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: This is why we don't have you as DM.
 MARISHA: This ankle is affecting my wisdom! It's reaching into my family's history!
 LIAM: Dungeons and Dragons is about punishment.
 MATT: The three of you dart on the outside and make your way down the alley behind what looks to be a cluster of empty rain barrels that are set up to catch during storms, and you appear to have managed to just avoid the sight of the guarding crownsguard on the outside of the inn. Caleb and Nott, what are you guys doing?
 LIAM: We're scouting the way nonchalantly, I would imagine.
 SAM: I'm real! I'm with you!
 MATT: So they darted off into the alley, what are you guys doing?
 LIAM: We could make our way to the outskirts of town.
 SAM: I said that I would be on lookout duty, so I'm just peering-- Wait they went to the alley to go?
 MATT: While he was distracting them, you saw the guard leave with Fjord.
 SAM: We'll go with, right?
 LIAM: No, we can stay in the open. I send Frumpkin up into the air over the party, 100 feet in the air.
 SAM: We're just going out in the open to the water.
 TALIESIN: We can also follow the bird.
 MARISHA: Yeah, I was going to say, why don't you guys lead the way, and you guys give us a signal if you guys see a guard.
 MATT: You aren't there. You haven't caught up with them yet, they're still out in the open.
 TALIESIN: I miss the earrings.
 LIAM: So I take your hand, and I'm watching them from above.
 SAM: I'm guiding him along.
 MATT: So the two of you make your way towards the docks slowly.
 LIAM: I'm totally acting like I see everything. 
 MATT: Right. I see everything.
 LAURA: I have my hood up.
 TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I'm over cloak.
 TRAVIS: Weekend at Bernie's walking. Looking around at nothing.
 MATT: You guide for two and a half blocks and the guard's still like, "Where is it?"
 TRAVIS: I look over my shoulder and keep running, and then go: Oh, what do you want? Who are you? Why are you following me?
 MATT: "You called me-- You said there was one of them--"
 TRAVIS: Have I done something again? Have you seen my son? What's your name? You're a strong looking--
 MATT: He sheathes the blade.
 TRAVIS: Oh dear. Do you have any coin?
 LIAM: It's badass.
 MATT: He walks up and slaps you across the top of the head, and just goes, "Don't go wasting our time."
 TRAVIS: I'm sorry. No respect for the elderly, apparently. I walk away.
 MATT: He spits on the ground towards you and turns around and heads back to his post.
 TRAVIS: (grunting) I make my way towards the docks.
 MATT: You all manage to slowly make your way to the outskirts of the Ustaloch, down to where the majority of the docks are set up on the lake itself. Since the lights have gone out, most of the boats have now come back in, and they are bringing in their hauls out, and have small nets and baskets filled with fish they've caught while they're out there, small crustaceans, most of them are in the process of just offloading and locking up and tying their boats. What are you guys doing?
 LIAM: I think perhaps the best thing to do is to rent a boat, not steal a boat.
 LAURA: You should talk to people.
 TRAVIS: I think we may be able to avoid any kind of trading of currency.
 LIAM: What's your idea?
 TRAVIS: Let me see if I can find a boat that would accommodate all of us and see if we can find some amicable people. 
 LIAM: All right.
 TRAVIS: As a sailor, apparently I'm able to acquire free passage on ships.
 MATT: You are, actually. One of the larger fishing vessels that can carry a group of your size, as well as a couple of others, has already been pulled in and most everyone has been loaded off. You can see there's one gentleman in his mid-forties, a little bit of a five o'clock shadow on his chin, a small scar across the bottom of it. He has a heavy knitted cap that's folded back onto the top of his shoulders and a long coat, and as he's standing there, he looks over at you and watches you approach, taking the rope and tying it around the edge. 
 TRAVIS: Hello there. I was hoping that perhaps I could trouble you. We're trying to make our way out into the lake, some of my companions and I, for a small day trip. We've never quite been out on the lake, not this one. Is there a chance we could trade some work on your day's journey for some travel? 
 MATT: "If you're looking for someone to take you around the lake, I could do that for a bit of coin, sure."
 TRAVIS: I'm sorry, we're a bit light on coin. Is there perhaps anything we could help you with around here in trade? 
 MATT: He glances at your hands as you're talking, "I like a hard-worker."
 TRAVIS: Indeed. Many years of my life. 
 MATT: "Where are you from?"
 TRAVIS: Port Damali. 
 MATT: "I see you've been a shiphand before. I can see the cracks in the fingers."
 TRAVIS: They never go away.
 MATT: He looks at his own hand. "So you're just looking for a joyride?"
 TRAVIS: Yes, it would help me look a bit more impressive in the eyes of my younger comrades.
 MATT: "I'll tell you what. I'll take you around. You get a bottle to take more out there, we'll call it even."
 TRAVIS: Much obliged. 
 MATT: "All right." He goes and starts getting the boat ready to go back out on the lake.
 TRAVIS: I go back. It fucking worked.
 LAURA: That was pretty cool, Gramps. 
 TRAVIS: Thanks. We should go. 
 MATT: He's getting ready. The trade was to bring a bottle. 
 TRAVIS: A bottle! Right. You don't happen to carry any fine firewhiskey on you, do you?
 SAM: Nope. 
 TRAVIS: If I gave you some money, could you go pick us up a nice bottle of some stuff?
 SAM: Yes. 
 TRAVIS: I don't trust you. If I gave you some money, could you--?
 LAURA: Yes, you can definitely trust me. 
 TRAVIS: I don't trust you either. Beau, I'm going to give you three gold.
 MARISHA: That's too much, but do I get to keep the change?
 TRAVIS: No. 
 MARISHA: Damn it. I'll be right back. I go get two bottles. 
 MATT: A bottle of fine wine runs you about ten gold pieces. A bottle of basic wine, about a gold. This is some Two-Buck Chuck style of wine. 
 TRAVIS: You can't come back with ten gold wine if I said I was broke. 
 MARISHA: Exactly. 
 TALIESIN: Two-Gold Bold.
 MATT: You spend the gold and you get a bottle of cheap wine, make your way back to the boat--
 LAURA: Can I pull Fjord aside while she's off doing that? 
 MATT: Yeah. 
 LAURA: Fjord, that voice you're doing. It almost sounded like you actually did in Port Damali. 
 TRAVIS: Right, yeah. 
 LAURA: I mean, I like that voice. I like this voice too, though. 
 TRAVIS: Oh, well I'm glad. I'm partial to it myself. 
 LAURA: I like it. You can keep doing it. 
 MATT: As you return with the bottle, you all get onto the boat. The older gentleman, as you all get on, introduces himself: "I'm Noah, this is my vessel. I'll take you where you need to go. Now, if I can ask where you're headed. Want to do a pass on the lake and back, or..."
 SAM: Caleb, where are we headed? 
 LAURA: Wait, are you still in bird mode?
 LIAM: No. That ended. We hear that there's beautiful islands out in the middle of the Ustaloch.
 MATT: As he pulls the rest of the rope in as you guys are on board, he stops. “Beautiful?"
 TRAVIS: They haven't been on the water much. An island to the eyes of someone like him could appear--
 LIAM: I've never seen a lake before this one so, first island. It's a very big moment for me.
 MATT: He goes and gets his paddle out and begins making his way-- "Well there's only two islands out there. One's a piece of shite and the other's Crookedstone."
 LAURA: What's Crookedstone? 
 MATT: "Crookedstone used to be where and old witch lived about a hundred years ago."
 (gasps)
 MATT: "No one goes over to Crookedstone."
 TALIESIN: Well!
 (laughter)
 MARISHA: No one goes to Crookedstone. 
 TALIESIN: That is our siren's call. 
 LIAM: Did you say piece of shite? What's the name of the other one? 
 MATT: "Well, it doesn't really have a name. It's too small."
 LAURA: Oh, so the big one is Crookedstone? 
 LIAM: Crookedstone, yeah. 
 MATT: "Can I ask you where you're going?"
 LAURA: I mean, that sounds like fun, right? 
 MARISHA: Yeah, you guys aren't actually afraid of some--
 MATT: He puts the oar down--
 SAM: Boink.
 MATT: (cork removal noise) (gulps) (sighs)
 TALIESIN: No aerator? 
 (laughter)
 SAM: You monster!
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: You've ruined it.
 MATT: "Fair be it to me to judge. To Crookedstone, then." He picks up his oar and begins paddling.
 LAURA: Tell me more about this witch!
 MATT: "I don't know. Probably died many years ago and no one goes around, seeing as it's cursed land. You'll see for yourself soon enough."
 LAURA: Did she have a wart on her nose?
 MATT: "Probably."
 LAURA: Yeah.
 MATT: "We don't really deal with witch folk."
 LAURA: Did she have a hat? Like a pointy one?
 MATT: "I'd only expect as such."
 LAURA: Right? 
 MATT: (chuckles) Takes another swig as you guys begin to make your way towards the center of the Ustaloch--
 TRAVIS: Can I put an arm around Beau and have her come to the front of the boat so we can check out the waters as we're going, just for anything that might be--
 MATT: Sure. Both of you make a perception check, please. 
 TALIESIN: I'm going to keep my eyes peeled as well.
 MATT: Sure.
 LAURA: I'm going to draw witches in my sketchbook.
 MARISHA: (yelling) God fucking shitballs cock!
 LIAM: I actually tagged along with them. 
 MATT: Okay. 
 TALIESIN: (growls and sighs)
 LAURA: So it went well? 
 MARISHA: (high-pitched) It's great. It's a good roll.
 SAM: I'm drinking tons of whiskey because I'm super scared to be on the water. 
 TALIESIN: Eight.
 TRAVIS: 13. 
 LIAM: 20.
 MATT: Okay. For future note, if everyone's going to make a perception check I may have a few folks, you know, to helm it, and other people aiding their roll with advantage. Just so we don't end up having a barrage of perception like, "They failed? *I* do it. They failed? *I* do it." Because that gets a little lame. All right, as you guys keep watch over the edge of the water, heading in as the sky darkens, heading towards Crookedstone, the island in the center of the Ustaloch. Prepare yourselves for whatever you'll find there and we're going to go to break!
 TRAVIS: Crookedstone, here we come!
 MATT: It's time. We're going to go ahead and take a quick ten minute break, roughly. We have ten minutes so we get a little bathroom break. We'll be back here shortly. Make sure to stick around for a video at the break in which we have our Wyrmwood contest to win some awesome Wyrmwood stuff, so keep an eye. We'll be back here in a little bit. See you soon. 
 
 Part II Edit 
 MATT: Welcome back! Sam!
 TRAVIS: Wow. There's Hail Mary's and then there's that.
 LIAM: (laughing)
 MATT: Oh, I'm going to get you guys back one of these days real hard.
 MARISHA: You already do.
 TRAVIS: Don't poke the DM.
 LIAM: Did that make it in? That was a nuke!
 MATT: Welcome back.
 TALIESIN: I was weirdly expecting more.
 TRAVIS: Are you kidding?
 MATT: Our winner of the grandiose collection of Wyrmwood elements is koehlerart. Congratulations, you're the winner. Danoba will contact you and get your information. Pretty nice win on your part. We'll have next week another giveaway to look forward to that.
 LAURA: I choked on my spit as I wooed.
 MATT: You swooed? Don't do that.
 TALIESIN: I don't even know how you did that!
 MATT: The sun has set, as you guys approach the outer banks of the Crookedstone Island in the center of the Ustaloch. You can see the grove, a clustered central conglomerate of trees that all create this mound of brush. Now that you're up close against it, you can see the bit of moonlight that's starting to come over the horizon dancing across the upper part of the canopy. The trees, at most, are about 15 to ten feet tall. They're not incredibly huge. Some even hovering around the five to ten foot range on the outskirts.
 LAURA: How tall was the lizard man? Devil Toad?
 MATT: He was about eight feet tall, hunched forward.
 LAURA: Okay.
 LIAM: That's big.
 MATT: As you approach the bank, you can see already there's a lot of heavy rocks. This is not a soft, muddy embankment like the outskirts of the lake. This has a lot of jagged rock, and your ship-finding friend is carefully making his way through as close as he can before he comes to a stop, pushes off with an oar, and says, "All right, I think this is as close as I can get. What are you doing here, if I might ask?"
 LAURA: We are going to have a picnic on the island.
 MARISHA: Beach party.
 LAURA: Nighttime beach party!
 MATT: Make a deception check.
 SAM: Nighttime beach party.
 TRAVIS: We're carrying nothing.
 LAURA: Wait, what is it, a deception? 14.
 MATT: “Sorry I asked.”
 MARISHA: The nighttime is the best time to go frog-digging.
 MATT: "I'll tell you what."
 SAM: That is true.
 TRAVIS: Kentucky.
 MARISHA: Yeah!
 MATT: "I get the sense the less I know, the better off I am. Go about your business, I'll be waiting here. Don't do anything stupid. I'm not getting involved with anything. If there's some illegal business here and I see something shifty, I'm back on the shore and you have to swim your way home."
 TRAVIS: Of course. Would someone help me down?
 LAURA: Here, I'll help you, Gramps. On either side.
 SAM: All you need to know is, there's three dudes and three ladies. You do the math.
 TALIESIN: Don't do the math.
 MATT: He takes the bottle and takes a big, heavy swig, and sits down in the boat.
 TRAVIS: We'll return.
 MATT: All right. As you guys step off the boat into about ankle-deep water, traversing the broken bits of sharpened stone, making your way to the actual island of Crookedstone, you begin to slowly approach the outside of the treeline. What do you guys want to do?
 LAURA: Should I cast Good and Evil Detection again?
 SAM: That seemed to work.
 LAURA: I can do it.
 TALIESIN: Before you do, let's take a look around. I'm going to take a look around to see if I can find any footprints.
 MATT: Make an investigation check.
 TALIESIN: Can I use my (mumbles) again, or no?
 MATT: What are you doing? Are you looking around for details?
 TALIESIN: I'm specifically looking for signs of Kylre.
 MATT: Make a survival check, with advantage.
 LAURA: What was the name of the creature again?
 MARISHA: A nergaliid.
 SAM: Heavens to Murgatroyd.
 TALIESIN: Wow, that's awful. Wait, that's cocked.
 LIAM: We're under the light of the moons, correct?
 TALIESIN: That's awful. I can't even-- that's eight.
 MATT: It's hard to tell. Because it's such a rocky shore, there aren't a lot of signs of landfall.
 LIAM: Moonlight, at this point?
 MATT: Moonlight, and a little bit of dissipating orange-purple glow in the sky.
 TALIESIN: That's right, we've got some humans.
SAM: I did a Travis burp.
 MATT: Oh no.
 LAURA: He blew it out.
 SAM: I blew it that way!
 MARISHA: Thanks?
 TALIESIN: Oh wow.
 TRAVIS: You can taste it, can't you?
 MATT: What's the plan, guys?
 MARISHA: You didn't find anything?
 TALIESIN: We can start heading in.
 LAURA: I can cast it, I just will lose a spell slot.
 LIAM: Hold on. I send Frumpkin into the sky. Look down, and see if now that I have him flying closer, maybe I can see better, or see something moving in this dim light, before it goes?
 MATT: Perception check on Frumpkin, please.
 LAURA: Roll really good.
 MATT: With disadvantage because of the lack of light.
 LIAM: Balls. That's a big seven.
 MARISHA: We're lowly humans. How did you deal with this?
 TALIESIN: It was awful. I let all of you go first everywhere.
 MATT: Yeah, the lack of detail, nothing really catches Frumpkin's eye from above.
 LIAM: It's too dark. (flutters)
 MARISHA: Can I look and see if I see any big broken branches, or sign of something big moving through the forest?
 MATT: Make a perception check.
 MARISHA: Perception? Not investigation?
 MATT: Are you glancing about, or are you going to wade through the forest to look for things?
 LIAM: No ranger.
 MARISHA: I'd like to move up to the treeline and see where the mud is, and see if I can see any sign of something big moving through the forest.
 TALIESIN: Or for a witch's hut.
 MATT: Make an investigation check.
 LAURA: It's a big island.
 MARISHA: That's the same damn fucking roll. Piece of shit.
 MATT: Which is good, because the first roll should have stayed anyway. Works out well.
 MARISHA: Investigation? Seven.
 MATT: Seven. It's hard to tell in the dark, unfortunately. Your human eyes prevent you from finding any details in the vicinity without a light source. The faint bit of moonlight gives you the general structure of the island, but beyond that, even looking close, you have a hard time making out details.
 TRAVIS: How about we fan out and move in?
 LAURA: Okay.
 TRAVIS: Keep a line. Within eye shot of each other.
 MARISHA: Like looking for drowned kids?
 TRAVIS: Well, yeah.
 MARISHA: Make a line.
 LIAM: Because I can't see anything, I'm going to hand on your shoulder.
 SAM: Guide you through.
 MATT: Okay. What is the order in which you guys are walking or fanning out?
 SAM: The exact order that our minis are, right there.
 MARISHA: You know, it kind of works.
 TRAVIS: Put me next to Beau.
 TALIESIN: Let's the humans in the middle, so that they can't be surprised.
 MARISHA: Put Fjord on the outside. There we go.
 SAM: Well, not the exact order.
 LIAM: Do we want to do it like a V-formation, with Nott in the lead and the two humans just behind?
 SAM: We're fine like this.
 LAURA: Nott should be next to Caleb, because he can't see. So Nott should be right next to Caleb.
 TRAVIS: Jester and Nott switch.
 MARISHA: Just don't spread out too far to where we're not in shouting distance.
 LAURA: Okay. So we spread.
 MATT: Technically, you're in the-- We'll go with this.
 ALL: It's fine.
 SAM: We're all going to die anyway.
 TALIESIN: Again.
 MATT: You guys all carefully make your way into the treeline. The smell here is definitely that of low tide. You get that unearthing of sediment, and the occasional whiff of dead fish.
 LAURA: Do we smell any brimstone?
 MATT: No, not at the moment. You guys push further in. Are you being quiet about this?
 ALL: Yeah.
 MATT: Then I would like you all to make a stealth check.
 TALIESIN: Hey! There's my good roll!
 MARISHA: That's all right.
 LAURA: 17.
 TALIESIN: 19.
 TRAVIS: 16.
 MARISHA: 17.
 LIAM: 15.
 SAM: 16.
 MATT and TRAVIS: Wow!
 TALIESIN: There's that magic we never had.
 MATT: As you guys slowly become a cohesive unit, a true adventuring party, you begin to carefully make your way through. Thankfully, most of the small tree cluster, this small glade, the floor of it is soft, and as you step, there's no heavy snapping of twigs or crumbling of leaves. Something does catch the edge of your foot on the outskirts, Fjord, as you glance down. You see what looks to be two crustacean shells: small crabs that have been fished out of the nearby lake, and have been completely eaten. The inside has been cleared out.
 TRAVIS: Hold for a second. These shells have been devoured.
 MARISHA: Oh. I pass it down the line. The shells have been devoured!
 LIAM: The bells have been deflowered.
 SAM: The whales are in my power!
 LAURA: The veils are covered in flour.
 (laughter)
 MATT: Something about being deflowered.
 SAM: Did Toya love crabs?
 TALIESIN: She ate what was put in front of her. We ate what was put in front of us. We're not picky people.
 MATT: You guys continue about 30 or so feet into the treeline, before you start finding, I wouldn't say a clearing, but the trees aren't as closely placed together. There is some semblance of an opening here and there.
 SAM: What?
 LAURA: Stop burping! Yes you did!
 SAM: I didn't burp!
 LAURA: You probably just breathed out hard.
 LIAM: I'm sorry, it was me.
 SAM: That was you?!
 LIAM: No, I meant Caleb's stink.
 SAM: I have not burped.
 TALIESIN: I'm trying to keep an eye out for anything.
 MATT: Unfortunately, you're having a hard time to make out any sign. You guys make your way towards the center of this cluster of trees.
 MARISHA: As we walk, Fjord and I will keep a lookout for any more crustacean empty shells.
 MATT: Okay. Make a perception check. Well, one of you do, the other can aid if you want to, and that gives you advantage on the roll.
 MARISHA: Help me. I get advantage?
 MATT: Yeah.
 MARISHA: Thank god you're helping me. Just perception? 20 total.
 MATT: You don't see any more crab shells, but you do glance a bit ahead, and amongst the trees, you can see stonework. Stones stacked in a wall that is toppled over and fallen. A small ruin. Some sort of a structure, once a single-story structure that seems to have fallen inward and been destroyed. Partially overgrown, and what little moonlight comes through, you can make out the shape of it. There's corners still standing, but other than that, it looks like it's been toppled over and left to ruin.
 MARISHA: Is that a cave? I think your eyes are better than mine.
 TRAVIS. Yeah. With my darkvision, can I zero-in on what she's looking at?
 MATT: If you get a little closer, you can, yeah.
 TRAVIS: I scoot up a little bit.
 MATT: Okay. You creep up and you can see it's a ruined building. It looks like it was 30 feet on one side, 15 feet on the other. It's destroyed.
 TRAVIS: I can see why they say a witch was here. It's pretty spooky in this light.
 TALIESIN: Even if we weren't here on business, I really want to see this.
 LAURA: Can we sneak around the hut?
 MARISHA: Can we surround the hut?
 MATT: There's no hut. It's a ruin.
 LAURA: Can we sneak around the ruin?
 MARISHA: We're building a narrative here that Matt is not giving us.
 MATT: Like The Secret. You're manifesting a witch fight here. "Where's the hut?"
 TRAVIS: Let's approach.
 MATT: You guys approach. Who's keeping visual point on this?
 MARISHA: Whose got better eyes?
 TRAVIS, TALIESIN, and LAURA: I have darkvision.
 LIAM: I'm moving slow on purpose at the back of the group now.
 TRAVIS: Which means you are, too.
 MATT: Who's helming this? I'll give one of you a perception roll to help on this.
 TRAVIS: Go for it, Molly.
 LAURA: No, we're pointing at you.
 TRAVIS: You're pointing at me? I don't want perception, you want Beau.
 MATT: Technically, I should have given Beau disadvantage because of her human eyes. I let it slide because you were looking for crustaceans.
 LAURA: I'll do it! Because I like witch huts, I'll do it. What's yours?
 TALIESIN: I'll do it.
 MATT: Because of you being a human.
 MARISHA: He basically saw it.
 MATT: I know. It worked out fine for the narrative.
 TALIESIN: I'll go for it. I don't get advantage on this.
 MATT: No.
 TALIESIN: No, okay. God. Six.
 MATT: It's too dark to see anything, even with your darkvision. It looks like a ruin. It could very well be that this island is abandoned.
 MARISHA: Does it look like, when we get up close to it, like it's caved in on top?
 MATT: It looks like whatever roof was has fallen in, and all there are are some semblances of the wall still standing, and corners to the structure, but most of it is either crumbled in entirely--
 LIAM: Yeah, this is like a famine home in Ireland. You can see the edges of it, probably.
 MATT: Yep.
 MARISHA: Fjord, give me a boost.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, sure.
 MARISHA: Getting up on the roof.
 MATT: Okay. You climb up onto-- there is no roof to it, per se. It's all fallen in.
 SAM: There's a full hut with a witch inside, Matt.
 (laughter)
 MATT: You want me to put a witch in this? You want me to throw a witch in this? There can be a witch, Sam!
 SAM: There's a full, two-story hut with a burning fireplace.
 LIAM: I'll pull out the Baba Yaga, give me five seconds.
 MATT: I got rules for this shit in the book.
 MARISHA: You hear a dice fall, "And...six witches come out."
 MATT: Yeah, going back to my first campaign. Roll for number of witches. As you vault up to the top edge of one of the stronger walls, you head up onto the side and glance to the back, right as a pair of red eyes (whoosh) right up at you, and this (growling).
 TRAVIS: We know that sound.
 MATT: I need you to roll initiative.
 TALIESIN: I did not sneak that in, did I?
 MATT: Nope.
 SAM: Everybody, or just her?
 MATT: All of you.
 LAURA: All of us?
 (cheering)
 MARISHA: Which dice? I haven't rolled this dice yet. Maybe it will be kind.
 SAM: Look at this well-constructed map.
 LIAM: Oh, shit snacks.
 MATT: There's Beau, right there.
 TRAVIS: Look at the size of that.
 LIAM: Look, you're up in the air, bro!
 LAURA: And little Toya.
 MATT: Whereabouts are you guys, currently?
 LIAM: I would be the furthest back.
 MARISHA: Fjord's right next to me.
 LAURA: Me and Molly were closer to it.
 MATT: Fjord's right there, giving you the boost up. You and Molly were close to it?
 LAURA: Closer than Caleb. Yeah, that's good.
 MATT: You guys are next to each other, because you're holding there. Molly moved up to probably here. Around there?
 TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm all right with that.
 LAURA: Yes, I'm good.
 MATT: Okay.
 TRAVIS: The trees are awesome. Oh man! That fucking music.
 MATT: Let's go ahead and-- oh shit, okay.
 LAURA: Oh no, they rolled really well.
 SAM: They? It's just one.
 LAURA: Toya's there too.
 SAM: Toya's just a dwarf girl.
 LAURA: She's going to pull out some shit.
 MARISHA: Yeah she is, don't trust that bitch.
 MATT: 25 to 20, anybody? Nott, since you got high-- You got higher than that last time. 20 to 15?
 TALIESIN: 18.
 MARISHA: 16.
 MATT: Hold on. We have Molly up front at 18. Who's next after that?
 MARISHA and LAURA: 16.
 LIAM: I'm at 15.
 TRAVIS: You and Frumpkin?
 MATT: For the ease of this, we're going to run with Frumpkin on your initiative order because otherwise it's another initiative we have to worry about.
 LIAM: So keep him with me?
 MATT: Yeah. All right, so, Caleb. 15 to ten?
 SAM: 11!
 MATT: All right, Nott. What did you get, Fjord?
 TRAVIS: Five.
 LAURA: Oh no.
 SAM: Wait, you can't see because you're looking through the sparrow, or because you're a human?
 LIAM: I'm human.
 SAM: That's why we're holding hands?
 LIAM: We're not holding hands anymore.
 MATT: Top of the combat round. Molly, you hear this growl, and you watch Beau begin to react and get the staff ready and you immediately know this is not good, but you're up first.
 TALIESIN: I'm going to pull out both my swords, and I'm going to drag them--
 LAURA and MARISHA: [imitating him] Borth your swords!
 SAM: Irish, Laura.
 TALIESIN: I'm not doing my accent right now. So I'm going to pull out both the swords, and I'm going to drag them on the back of my neck, and before the blood even begins to pour, it goes straight into ice along the blades.
 TRAVIS: Sick.
 MATT: You can only apply one per round on a bonus action.
 TALIESIN: Action, bonus action.
 MATT: Oh, you're doing both right now?
 TALIESIN: Action and bonus action.
 MATT: Technically it's a bonus action; you can't convert an action to a bonus action.
 TALIESIN: I can't turn an action to a bonus action?
 MATT: No. Unfortunately.
 TALIESIN: All right, that's fair.
 MATT: Yeah, you could apply it once, and then you still have your action if you want to.
 TALIESIN: Okay.
 MATT: You can mark down, you take down your temporary hit points or your max hit points to 22.
 TALIESIN: I'm going to move around and I'm going to try and get a little cover right here.
 MATT: Okay. You move there?
 TALIESIN: I'm going to move there, and I'm going to hold my attack until there's something to hit. I'm going to try and make little wave at Yasha. Toya. Ah, brain.
 MATT: It is now Kylre’s turn.
 TRAVIS: Oh, shit, right away.
 MATT: All right, seeing you right there, the devil toad turns to little Toya to the side, who looks a bit dirtied at a glance, and goes, "They're trying to take you away. Come, sing for us! Stop them!"
 MARISHA: I look down at Fjord and I go: Let me down! Help me down!
 TRAVIS: What?
 MATT: All right. The devil toad is going to straight leap, which would pass through your-- you get an attack of opportunity-- and land right there.
 TRAVIS: Look at the size of that thing.
 MATT: Make your attack, if you want to.
 MARISHA: I can't really do anything; it's just a wack, right?
 MATT: It's just a hit with your staff, yeah.
 MARISHA: Okay, 21.
 MATT: That hits! Go and roll damage.
 MARISHA: Just with my staff, right?
 MATT: Correct.
 MARISHA: Not great. Seven points of damage.
 MATT: Seven points of damage. You smack it on the way, with this horrible wet thud to the back its body, but it moves through with immense speed, especially with the density and the weight of this thing as it lands, the ground shakes in the area, the vicinity, and as it lands, it uses its action to Summon Devil. 
 MARISHA: Summon devil?
 MATT: As it lands, it begins to mutter a language under its breath. Anybody here speak Infernal?
 TALIESIN: Yeah.
 MATT: You hear an incantation that essentially amounts to a faint, "Come, protect me, brothers," beneath its breath, and three bursts of flame.
 SAM: Three!? Not three!
 MATT: As three imps apparate in the vicinity.
 MARISHA: Fucking imps!
 MATT: Here and here. Roll their initiative. Okay.
 LAURA: (singing) We're fucked. We're fucked.
 TRAVIS: So excited right now!
 MATT: That's his action, and Toya's up next! Toya actually rolled initiative just below.
 TRAVIS: She wants to be our friend.
 MATT: Toya is looking around, looking scared, looking at you motioning towards her. (sung note) Her haunting voice begins to spread from her and I need all of you to make a wisdom saving throw, please.
 TRAVIS: Oh, shit.
 SAM: 15.
 MARISHA: Also 15.
 TALIESIN: 20.
 TRAVIS: 17. Natural 17.
 LIAM: 20.
 SAM: Still 15.
 LAURA: Nine.
 MATT: Okay. That's some good saving throws, guys. All of you shake your head and back away. You: your eyes move towards her, and there's an enchantment that pulls your attention. You have disadvantage on any attack rolls you make for the next turn. She, scared, sees you, and begins to walk back this way and hide behind the wall, but continues to sing, giving this aura in the vicinity. That ends Toya's turn. Beau, you're up, as well as Jester.
 LAURA: I'm going to Invoke Duplicity.
 MATT: So that's your action? Where are you placing your--?
 LAURA: So she can appear anywhere?
 MATT: Let me see real fast. Still getting used to these new abilities.
 SAM: Use your DandD Next to look at the information about that spell.
 MATT: It appears anywhere within 30 feet of you in an unoccupied space.
 LAURA: Tight. Okay, she's going to appear in the tree in front of me. Next to Fjord.
 SAM: Wait, did you have two minis made for yourself?
 LAURA: No, Matt did the second one! Isn't that cool!?
 SAM: Ah, wow.
 LAURA: Then as me, I'm going to run away. Can I run behind a tree and crouch?
 MATT: You can go around this one there.
 LAURA: I'm going to crouch behind it.
 MATT: That gives you some cover. That's your turn. Beau, you're up.
 LAURA: That’s my turn.
 MARISHA: I'm going to vault off of the platform that I'm on, and I'm going to go for Toya. I'm going to take my bo staff. I'm going to try and take her where her throat is and grapple her down to the ground. Like to basically throat crush and get on top of her.
 MATT: All right, make an acrobatics check.
 TRAVIS: Little larynx assault.
 LAURA: I feel like Beau will have far less problems hurting children.
 MARISHA: Yeah. Okay. 15.
 MATT: Yeah. You make the landing, roll, and go towards her. You're going to use your action to grapple?
 MARISHA: Grapple her down.
 MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check, please.
 LIAM: Put her in a body bag, Johnny!
 TRAVIS: That was so close.
 MARISHA: It's a 14. Yeah, I know, you can barely see that one. Athletics you said? 19. 18, sorry!
 MATT: As you land, you manage to grapple Toya and using the staff you press her against the wall, and the scared dwarf girl's eyes are open wide. The singing falters for a second, but she continues to still sing, and you see her eyes looking around desperately for--
 MARISHA: Do I have a bonus?
 MATT: I mean, you have a bonus action, yes.
 MARISHA: Can I crush in a little bit further and get her to stop singing?
 TALIESIN: I'm so proud of you.
 SAM: Crush that windpipe.
 MARISHA: Just a little!
 MATT: Technically a grapple is an attack, so it's an attack action, so yeah. You can.
 MARISHA: That's right. Y'all thought Keyleth was a fuck up. What am I doing, just a straight attack?
 MATT: Just a straight attack. If you're just hitting, or pushing ahead with it, I'll say.
 MARISHA: 11.
 MATT: 11? Does not hit, actually.
 LAURA: She's got the strongest windpipe ever.
 MATT: It's more that fact that as you're pressing in, she's adjusting her body and she's reaching up, grabbing, and trying to keep her voice emitting from her throat. You can't seem to get a beat to press. She looks genuinely really scared and freaking out at being put in this position.
 MARISHA: I'm just going to say: I felt bad for you before, but now you *should* be scared.
 MATT: Okay. That ends Beau's turn. Caleb, you're up.
 LIAM: Question: is the humans' visibility shit right now?
 MATT: Yeah, there's no light in here.
 LIAM: So I can't see what I'm doing, right?
 MATT: Most any roll you'd be making would be at disadvantage.
 LIAM: Okay, so four globules of light go (popping) out of my hands and one of them hovers--
 MATT: Actually, we have a light for this. Forgot about that! I should've put that on. Hints of moonlight.
 LIAM: It's a row of four globules of light. One is hanging above where my miniature is now. One is closer to froggy. One is, like a line over the building, so that there's one also hanging over Beauregard.
 MATT: We'll say within this vicinity here, the entire center of the island now glows. You can see the ruins casting shadows off against the rocks in the vicinity from where each globe is placed. You all have a pretty good view of the battlefield at the moment.
 LIAM: With my remaining movement, I'm hauling ass towards Fjord and whichever Jester that is ahead of me.
 MATT: You can get right behind Fjord if you want to. That ends Caleb's turn. Nott, you're up.
 SAM: Okay. Seeing where Caleb has run-- If I move, will that imp next to me get an attack?
 MATT: One way to find out.
 SAM: Okay. Well then, I will turn to the imp next to me and I will slash at it with my shortsword.
 MATT: Okay, go for it.
 SAM: Two.
 LAURA: Don't you add something?
 MATT: Eight.
 MATT: As you swing wide, it flaps its wings backward and the tiny demonic humanoid creature with its wings in the air goes (cackling).
 SAM: All right, I will bonus action disengage and run to Caleb.
 MATT: Okay, there's that.
 TRAVIS: Disengage, baby!
 LIAM: So proud! So proud!
 MATT: Okay, so you're all clustered up here behind the ruins. 
 LAURA: So smart.
 SAM: They can't get us over here. 
 (laughter)
 MATT: All right, so that finishes your turn, Nott. Fjord, you're up. 
 TRAVIS: Over the top of the ruins, can I see the hellish toad?
 MATT: You can. With the light that's burning up there, it only goes about maybe five or six feet there. You have a good view of the creature. 
 TRAVIS: Can I use for my bonus action my Hexblade's Curse? 
 MATT: That you can!
 TALIESIN: What?! Hexblade's Curse?
 TRAVIS: I gain bonus to my damage rolls. A 19 or a 20 is a crit. When it dies, I might get something. 
 MATT: As you focus on it, and you condense your attention, you guys watch as the blade in Fjord's hand shimmers slightly. What was previously a faint bit of polished metallic suddenly begins to grow something organic looking. A cluster of barnacles begin to appear out of the hilt of the weapon and curl down about three or four inches down the blade, and it begins to drip water, sourceless. Like it was freshly pulled out of the ocean. The shadows that had been drawn from the nearby bits of stonework begin to tear into the body of the devil toad who looks around at the ground as there's now this squirrely swirling bit of black energy that's wrapping around and causing it to look about confused at its torso. That's your bonus action. 
 TRAVIS: I'm coming for you. I'll roll around the right side so I can see Toya.
 MATT: All right. 
 TRAVIS: I'll use Eldritch Blast at Toya being held down by Beau. 
 MARISHA: He gets advantage, right, because she's pinned? 
 MATT: You're shooting Toya? Or are you shooting the toad?
 TRAVIS: I'm sorry. The toad. 
 MARISHA: Oh sorry, sorry, sorry. 
 TRAVIS: That is a 19. That is a critical. 
 MATT: For the Hexblade's Curse, we'll have to double check.
 TRAVIS: Oh, it is melee.
 MATT: It is for your melee. I don't think it's for spells unfortunately.
 TRAVIS: That's right. It is melee. Yeah, I'm staying right there. Plus six, so that's a 25. 
 MATT: Yeah, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage. 
 SAM: Every time he casts a spell, does it go (sings Dueling Banjos). 
 (laughter) 
 TRAVIS: 13, 14, 15.
 MATT: 15?! Slick.
 LIAM: From that blast? Sick. 
 MATT: Because it’s plus--?
 TRAVIS: 1d8 plus four, plus two for the Hexblade's Curse. 
 MATT: The hexblade-- is that also for a melee weapon though? 
 TRAVIS: Bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. It equals my proficiency bonus. 
 MATT: Great, yeah. That's 15? With that as you snipe through the pommel of your blade, the energy blast strikes and the toad-- as it impacts, the shadows seem to grab the bolts of energy and tear them back towards it's torso causing additional damage as it (grunts in pain). 
 TRAVIS: Can I use the rest of my movement-- yeah, no, I'm good where I am.
 MATT: Okay. That's the end of your turn. Top of the round. Now the imps go. 
 SAM: Oh boy. 
 LAURA: Imps are the top of the round? 
 MATT: Yep. 
 LAURA: Jeez louise.
 TRAVIS: Times three right? 
 LIAM: Nope, that's a mistake. You also don't mean to do that.
 MATT: Two, three, four. 
 TRAVIS: Twenty feet speed.
 MATT: Oh no, it's a 40 foot fly speed!
 (groans)
 MARISHA: Of course it is.
 TALIESIN: Opening your mouth right there. That was so useful! So useful!
 MATT: All right, cool. With that, all three are of them are going to make a sting strike. That's one against you, Caleb. That's a natural three plus five. That's eight. 
 LIAM: Ooh, it almost got me though. 
 MATT: Misses you. Against Nott, that-- Jesus. Nine. 
 SAM: No. 
 MATT: Then Molly. A 17 plus five.
 TALIESIN: Yep, that hit me. 
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: Actually, is it close enough to me that I would have taken a swipe at it anyways? 
 MATT: You would have. You take your strike as it comes into range. 
 TALIESIN: That's a 13? 
 MATT: 13 does hit. Just hits!
 TALIESIN: That's a 1d6 plus 1d4. That's eight damage plus one cold damage, so nine damage. 
 MATT: Nine points of damage. As it swings down with its wings, you arc out with your scimitar and you carve through its body. It looks horribly hurt, blood spatters across your arm and across your forearm from the creature. 
 MATT: But it still survives and jams its stinger into you. It's cocked. That is five points of piercing damage and you have to make a constitution saving throw, please.
 TALIESIN: Five points of damage and a constitution saving throw.
 MATT: Correct.
 TALIESIN: Constitution saving throw. God damn it. 11.
 MATT: 11 is just what you need to succeed! You only suffer four points of poison damage. Nine points of damage total.
 SAM: That's nothing! You're fine.
 TALIESIN: That's a lot.
 SAM: We each have like 150 hit points.
 TRAVIS: The Hexblade’s Curse is on any damage, it's not melee. 
 MATT: Correct.
 TRAVIS: I could roll an extra damage die, and it would be for that crit. The 19.
 MATT: Oh wait! Okay.
 TRAVIS: It doesn't have to be melee. I had it right there and I should've read it.
 MATT: Thank you for clarifying. Go ahead and roll another die.
 TRAVIS: And it's a 1d10, not a 1d8. I was talking out my ass before. So ten.
 MATT: You rolled a ten?
 TRAVIS: No, I rolled four.
 MATT: Well, it's the additional die.
 TRAVIS: Thank you, just the four.
 MATT: So 19 damage on that one, nice.Good to know, thank you. That brings us to the end of the imp's turn. Molly, you're up.
 TALIESIN: I'm going to use my bonus action, take a slash at that imp. I can only use it as an action, right?
 MATT: Well, no. You have to attack with one hand and then as a bonus you can attack with the other.
 TALIESIN: Okay, I'll burn my attack hitting that bloody imp.
 MATT: You can attack with the one that's not enchanted if you wanted to.
 TALIESIN: No, I'll hit it with the enchanted one.
 MATT: Okay.
 TALIESIN: I'm really hurt and I just took nine points of damage.
 MATT: Go for it.
 TALIESIN: Yeah, 19 to hit.
 MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.
 TALIESIN: That's seven points of damage.
 MATT: With a scream and a burst of flame and sulfurous cloud, the imp flickers out of existence.
 TALIESIN: I'm going to pull back behind this tree trunk then and get a little cover to figure out what to do next, because I'm really hurt.
 MATT: Okay, you used your action, you still have your bonus action.
 TALIESIN: Yeah. I can't heal or anything. My god, I can't do anything.
 MATT: You can still attack with your bonus action if you wanted to. Okay, then back away. That's your turn then. Molly's done. Kylre, let's see here. He's going to make a standing leap. (counting) 30, he can land right there.
 SAM: Juggernaut.
 MATT: Lands right next to you, Caleb, you get knocked almost off your feet and barely hold yourself there. As it lands, you glance over your shoulder at it, its eyes burn ever bright and you feel this horrible sickening sensation crawl across your body, make a wisdom saving throw.
 LAURA: Oh god.
 LIAM: 20.
 MATT: That succeeds the saving throw.
 SAM: He's so wise!
 MATT: You are not stunned, as the siphon life deals four points of psychic damage to you. However, he gains four temporary hit points.
 TRAVIS: He gains four?
 MATT: Yes. The life that it pulls from you bolsters himself and it would've been a lot worse if you had failed, so that's good. All right, that's going to end Kylre's turn. Now going to Toya, who's still singing, I need everybody to make a wisdom saving throw, please.
 TALIESIN: 16.
 TRAVIS: 14.
 LAURA: 21.
 SAM: 19.
 MARISHA: 20.
 LIAM: What is this, wisdom? 23.
 MATT: Yes. You guys are rolling some crazy fucking saves!
 MARISHA: Just saves.
 MATT: Jesus. Well, Toya keeps singing. She's starting to cry now, you can see tears running down her face as you're pushing her into the wall. That ends Toya's turn, Beau and Jester, you're up.
 LAURA: Can I run away without getting hit?
 MATT: You don't know.
 LAURA: Okay. Do you want to do something first?
 MARISHA: Go for it, I'm just going to be like: Shh, shut up! So go ahead.
 LAURA: Okay. I'm going to, with my duplicity self, get up on the roof.
 MATT: All right.
 LAURA: Right there. She’s going to Guiding Bolt straight in his face.
 MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for the attack. Guiding Bolt is a ranged spell attack, correct?
 LAURA: Yes. Balls! Seven.
 MATT: Seven is not a hit. As you attempt to fire the bolt outward, the devil creature glances up and sees your secondary form and then ducks, as it blasts into the ground right by your feet, arcing past and exploding across the dirt and bits of-- whatever it is there. The word escaped me in the moment.
 SAM: Gore!
 MATT: Yes. Well, no, I was going to say compost. There you go, compost was the word I was looking for.
 LAURA: I am going to say: you are so stupid why did you get up on the roof like that?! That's why he saw you! I am going to run to the tree, straight back.
 MATT: Okay. As you come out of the way, the toad’s long-armed reach swipes out at you as a reaction. That is going to be 16 to hit. 
 LAURA: It doesn't hit me. 17.
 TRAVIS: You have AC 17?
 LAURA: I got a shield, bitches.
 MATT: As you run and dart, you see the giant arm coming down towards you, and you pull the shield up and it almost causes you to trip from the sheer force of the impact. But the brunt of it is taken by the shield as it scrapes off and you hear this horrible grinding of metal as its claws scoop across the outside of it. That ends your turn I believe. Beau.
 MARISHA: Okay, so I've got the little girl pinned, and I am going to go, shh. I am going to take my arm and--
 MATT: Are you trying to cover her mouth?
 MARISHA: Yep.
 MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an additional athletics check.
 MARISHA: I want to jam my whole forearm in her mouth.
 MATT: All right. Make an athletics check.
 MARISHA: Okay.
 LIAM: It’s your forte, so--
 MARISHA: Ten!
 MATT: She rolled a ten as well. That is considered--
 MARISHA: A roll off! I get to roll again!
 (laughter)
 MATT: No, I believe for contesting...
 TRAVIS: Yeah, because if it was AC, it would be just enough. But--
 MATT: Right. I'm looking at contesting grapple checks here real fast.
 TALIESIN: Ah, learning.
 TRAVIS: (inaudible auctioneer voice)
 (laughter)
 LAURA: That was Fjord’s other job.
 TRAVIS: As a manure salesman.
 (laughter)
 MATT: Doesn’t say as part of the rules. I'll say, for the hell of it, let's roll it one more time.
 MARISHA: Okay!
 SAM: It's a roll off!
 ALL: Its a roll off!
 MARISHA: Dance battle!
 LIAM: Get back in there, Rocky!
 MARISHA: Ah-- this one! Don't fuck me, blue! No, that's good, plus, my athletics, right?
 MATT: Yes.
 MARISHA: 16, thank you.
 MATT: Natural 18. This tiny little dwarf girl, her stout form still manages to pull your arm back from her mouth. The voice continues to build outward.
 SAM: It's because she is really a tentacle. She is part of him--
 MARISHA: Do I have a bonus action?
 MATT: Yeah, it was an attack, yeah. It was a grapple attack. You do.
 MARISHA: Can I try something else like that again, or do I just get an attack?
 MATT: I mean, what you want to do?
 MARISHA: Okay, my arm doesn't work. I am going to--
 LAURA: Punch her in the face!
 LIAM: Knock her the fuck out!
 MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to be like, fuck! I'm going to elbow her right in the temple and try and knock her out.
 MATT: Okay, make an attack.
 MARISHA: Natural 18. 24.
 MATT: That hits, roll damage.
 MARISHA: Right, 22, yes, 22. No, 24. I'm confused. Okay. 
 TRAVIS: New characters.
 MARISHA: New characters, new characters. Ah, yeah, okay, eight damage!
 MATT: Eight damage. Whack! As you smack her in the side of the head, her eyes roll back and she falls limp in your grasp. She's unconscious. 
 TRAVIS: Wow.
 MATT: The singing immediately stops. 
 LAURA: Oh, he is going to be so pissed!
 TRAVIS: Oh yeah, tiny dancer coming.
 MARISHA: That's all. That ends my turn right? I'm holding this girl?
 MATT: You have your movement. You are holding her there.
 MARISHA: Oh, I'm holding her? Can I drag her back a bit? Into the woods.
 MATT: Okay, it's half movement to drag her. That's as far as you can get.
 MARISHA: I'm going to be quiet. Can I support her head?
 MATT: As soon as the singing stops. (grunts) The toad looks over the shoulder and sees you dragging her back. What previously was this low, guttural growl becomes this bellowing scream of hatred. That ends your turn, Beau.
 LAURA: What are the odds you think that Yasha's on this island and she's going to come save us all?
 MATT: Caleb, your turn.
 LIAM: As soon as it starts roaring, I am surrounded, I have nowhere to go so I pull the diamond out, spin it, and the ice shards start to shoot and I pick it up and I throw it in his bellybutton.
 MATT: All right. You are in melee range with a creature doing a ranged spell attack, so go ahead and roll your attack. It has disadvantage.
 LIAM: That's okay because if I move I am dicked. That's not good. That's terrible. The second one was so good though. That's not great. That's ten.
 MATT: Unfortunately, as you're scared, the sound of its screaming causes you to shake as you release the blast. Unfortunately, your fingers lose the hold of your diamond for a moment and you have to actually catch it. As you do, the spell dissipates and fumbles. Anything else on your turn, Caleb?
 LIAM: I'm going to-- Nope. I'm going to stay there and freeze. Freeze up. That cat's a bird and she flies up straight.
 MATT: That ends Caleb's turn. Nott, you're up.
 TRAVIS: Warhorn.
 LAURA: Do something cool.
 SAM: I mean I can-- seeing Caleb surrounded, Nott will leap on to the beast's face and stab it in the neck.
 MATT: Which one, the toad?
 SAM: The big one.
 MATT: You will get an attack--
 SAM: I'll disengage first.
 MATT Okay, so you disengage as a bonus action. Move over--
 LAURA: You knocked me off the roof.
 MATT: I'm sorry.
 LAURA: She didn't feel anything. She doesn't have actual nerves.
 MATT: Exactly. As you push away from the imp as it tries to strike at you, seeing your friend in serious danger here, you dive into the shadows, leap into the air. Go ahead and roll an attack.
 SAM: 19
 MATT: 19 hits. Go ahead and roll damage plus sneak attack, because Caleb is in range.
 SAM: Nine, ten, plus fury of the small, 12.
 MATT: All right. So 12 points of damage. As you drive the blade into the devil toad, you see it plunge right to the hilt and it begins to bleed from the wound but its intention is still focused on the unconscious dwarf being dragged off by the monk. But that was a pretty sizeable blow. That ends your turn I believe. Fjord.
 TRAVIS: All right, I have a question. Hexblade's Curse. If I do another bonus action, does Hexblade's Curse keep going? It doesn't say-- it says if the curse ends early or if the target dies or you die or you're incapacitated, it drops but nothing else.
 MATT: Does it say it's concentration?
 TRAVIS: It doesn't say.
 MATT: Then I would say it's not concentration
 TRAVIS: Fucking-A. With my bonus action, can I cast Wrathful Smite?
 MATT: Yes you may.
 TRAVIS: May I charge el toad from hell-o?
 MATT: That you can. As you run through the space between that large rock and the exterior of the ruined building, your large blade, water drifts off of it behind. It seems to almost perpetually emanate its own source of water. You arc with the blade forward. Go ahead and make your strike.
 TRAVIS: 17 to hit.
 MATT: That hits.
 TRAVIS: Beautiful. This is a 1d8.
 MATT: Is it one-handed, or are you holding it with two hands.
 TRAVIS: I didn't really say.
 MATT: You did not
 TRAVIS: So I'll go with the lower of the two. 1d8 plus four. 12 plus a 1d6 psychic damage and he has to make--
 MATT: Was it plus four, right?
 TRAVIS: It is plus four.
 MATT: Your charisma's plus four. Then you get a plus two because of your Hex, so technically it's plus 16. Sorry, 14.
 TRAVIS: Let's see, 1d6 psychic damage, which is an additional one for 15. He makes a wisdom saving throw or he's frightened until the end of the spell.
 MATT: That is going to be a 12. What's the DC?
 TRAVIS: Oh, I think that's lower than my 14. I've got a spell save DC, y'all!
 MATT: As you rush through the air and the blade arcs, the water seems to glow as it comes off, like it becomes phosphorescent and as he impacts the blade into the side of the demon toad, there’s a flash of light and what’s left behind is the scar that you’ve cut through its body is now burning with this reminiscent ember where you just carved through its hide. It looks down at you, averts its gaze from the monk for a second, and goes (confused snarling). For a split second, for the first time, you see fear in its red burning eyes. 
 TRAVIS: Yes!
 MATT: How long does it last?
 TRAVIS: It lasts until he can make a wisdom check against the spell save DC.
 MATT: Again? Okay. So he has disadvantage on attacks and cannot move closer towards you.
 MARISHA: Amazing.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, he's frightened.
 MATT: That ends Fjord's turn. The imps are up now. This imp here is going to turn around and dart towards the cleric who ran off to the side and that one's going to attack Caleb. Caleb, that is going to be a 12 to hit? 
 LIAM: Deffo.
 MATT: That hits? 
 LIAM: Yeah.
 MATT: Okay. So you suffer, as the stinger hits you, for seven points of piercing damage. I need you to make a constitution saving throw, please.  
 SAM: No problem.
 LIAM: That's a 12. 
 MATT: A 12 succeeds. So you only suffer five points of poison damage.
 LIAM: Caleb is unconscious on the ground.
 LAURA: Oh no!
 MATT: The other imp attacking you, Jester. That is going to be a natural 19. Pretty sure that hits you at 24. You take six points of piercing damage and I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
 TALIESIN: Jesus, these things are so vicious.
 SAM: And you lose all your gold.
 LAURA: God (angry muttering)-- seven.
 LIAM: Jeez, this is going south guys.
 MATT: Actually, that's not too bad. Six points of poison damage. 
 LAURA: So 12 total?
 MATT: Correct. 
 TALIESIN: Oh my god. 
 MATT: All right, that's going to end the imps' turn. Molly, you're up. 
 TALIESIN: (groaning) Shit. 
 LIAM and SAM: Get her done.
 TALIESIN: I'm going to get a little closer, I'm going to start running towards the ruins.
 MATT: That's 30 feet there.
 TALIESIN: That'll do it. I'm going to look at the imp and I'm, in Infernal, I'm going to say, to just-- terrible: There's nothing but death for you here. I'm going to attack Vicious Mockery on him and show him the bottom card.
 SAM: Are you a bard?! What the fuck?
 MATT: Variant tiefling. 
 TALIESIN: I have to learn some-- Yeah, that's a--
 MATT: A wisdom saving throw? 
 TALIESIN: Yeah, it's wisdom saving throw. 
 MATT: That is going to be a no with a seven, I'm pretty sure.
 TALIESIN: I'm trying to figure out how this works but--
 LIAM: By the way, when Caleb went down those four balls of light disappeared. 
 MARISHA: No!
 TALIESIN: It's not a lot, but that's four points of psychic damage and he has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes.
 MATT: All righty, good to know.
 TALIESIN: That was just my bonus action, I'm going to use my action--
 MATT: Vicious Mockery is an action.
 TALIESIN: No that's a-- it is an action, you're right. That's what I’ve got right now. Just trying to get its attention.
 MATT: Okay. That ends your turn. It is now Kylre's turn who is-- (laughs) oh man, yeah. He was about to go right after Beau, but he's scared of you and cannot move closer towards you. He's going to take a swing at Nott. He's like (panicked muttering) and try to squash the small thing right there, with disadvantage. That is 16. 
 SAM: 16. 
 MATT: 16's your armor class? That hits. 11 points of piercing damage as the claw strikes out at you, and I need you to make a constitution saving throw. 
 TALIESIN: Oh my god. We're not doing well.
 SAM: Ten.
 MATT: Ten is just what you needed to succeed. The poison from the claws of the toad does not set into your system.
 TRAVIS: I can't believe this shit.
 MARISHA: I know. Who's down? You're down?
 TALIESIN: He's the only one who's down but we're all hurt.
 LAURA: And I've got a thing right in front of me so I can't--
 MATT: Kylre's going to-- out of sheer panic now from you-- try to flee. So he's going to leap and land over here. You do both get attacks of opportunity on the toad. Would not have fled except for that fear effect. He's like, "Fuck, I got to run."
 SAM: 22.
 MATT: That hits.
 TRAVIS: 18.
 MATT: Hits.
 TRAVIS: Can I grab the sword with two hands, please?
 MATT: Sure.
 SAM: Eight points.
 MATT: Eight points of damage. You added sneak attack to that, right?
 SAM: Why do I get sneak attack?
 MATT: Because he is next to it.
 SAM: All right. 11 points.
 MATT: 11 points of damage. Nice.
 TRAVIS: 11 points of damage, and does that trigger another psychic attack?
 MATT: How does the effect on that work?
 TRAVIS: It says the next time that you hit with a melee weapon attack during the spell's duration--
 MATT: Yes, it does.
 TRAVIS: Okay. So that's 11 plus five, so 16?
 MATT: 16 points of damage. All righty.
 TRAVIS: Concentration. Can't use something else. Committed.
 MARISHA: It's a bitch, isn't it? Concentration's a bitch.
 MATT: As an action it has to try and save against the spell, ending the effect. Damn, that's crazy. All righty, so that being the case, that's going to end Kylre's turn. Lands, looks over at you hiding behind the tree--
 TALIESIN: Oh god, no.
 MATT: Toya, death saving throw. That's a success. All righty, that brings us to Beau and Jester. What are you guys doing, Beau and Jester?
 LAURA: You can go first this time.
 MARISHA: I can go first? Who am I next to? Who's Beau next to?
 MATT: You're right here, right next to Toya.
 MARISHA: And Fjord is in between... I'm too far away from everything.
 MATT: Teah.  
 MARISHA: Can I run-- I want to pick her up--
 MATT: It's half movement with her if you bring her.
 MARISHA: That's fair. No, I'm sorry. I want to move this way towards Molly.
 MATT: Okay. Double move?
 MARISHA: Yeah, and I'll try and get behind-- I've got a 40-foot movement.
 MATT: That's right. So you can get there.
 MARISHA: Okay. Do I have any type of bonus action or anything?
 MATT: You have your bonus action.
 MARISHA: Can I yell, "Kylre!" And I want to hold up the girl and be like, "come get her!"
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: Fuck, man.
 MATT: Kylre, between the trees and being frightened of Fjord, doesn't seem to notice you at the moment. He's currently focused on the fear effect.
 MARISHA: Yeah, I tried.
 MATT: That's all good. That ends your turn. Jester?
 LAURA: Okay. I'm going to cast-- fuck-- Cure Wounds on myself.
 MATT: Okay.
 TALIESIN: Glad you didn't do Detect Evil?
 LAURA: Yeah. Oh, that's good! Nine points of damage healed. Okay. Which is going to go away as soon as I turn and run away from the imp towards Fjord, around the trees so that the frog guy doesn't get an attack on me.
 MATT: Well, you're still in his combat range, actually. He has a ten-foot range.
 LIAM: Stay. Maybe he'll be distracted by fear.  
 MATT: He does have disadvantage on the attacks because of the fear effect, so that's helpful. Do you want to run through this way?
 LAURA: I guess, yeah.
 TALIESIN: He can't follow you.
 MATT: 30, that puts you there. Both the imp and Kylre get an--
 TALIESIN: Both have disadvantage.
 MATT: The imp because...
 TALIESIN: Vicious Mockery.
 MATT: Oh, that's right, yeah. That's right.
 TALIESIN: Part of the plan!
 LIAM: Damn. We're in a tight spot.
 MATT: That Vicious Mockery brings the imp's attack down to a nine, so the stinger whips past you. Kylre’s giant claw reaches out and tries to catch you as you run past. Natural 20 and a three.
 (sighing)
 MATT: That puts you at a nine, which I'm pretty sure misses. As you rush past, you hear the (boom) of the ground behind you and bits of dirt and rock throw up, tapping the back of your head from the impact of Kylre's grasp hitting the ground.
 LAURA: I'm just running away saying: Shit, shit, shit!
 MATT: That ends your turn?
 LAURA: I guess so.
 MATT: That brings us to Caleb. I need you to make a death saving throw.
 LIAM: Success.
 MATT: Okay, that's one success in that. Nott.
 SAM: There is an imp still in front of us?
 MATT: Yes. There is an imp that just knocked Caleb to the ground.
 LIAM: He's going to fuck me up.
 SAM: Okay. I will just shoot him with an arrow. I'm like ten feet away?
 MATT: Yeah. 15 feet from him.
 SAM: 15 feet. I'll draw and shoot.
 MATT: You pull out your hand crossbow.
 SAM: Oh boy, ten.
 MATT: Ten? That does not hit, unfortunately. It ducks out of the way.
 SAM: And then I will--
 TALIESIN: You have so few actions.
 SAM: I really do. I will cover Caleb's body with mine.
 TALIESIN: Does that work?
 SAM: We'll see.
 MATT: You move onto Caleb's space and use your body as a shield. Okay, that ends Nott's turn. Fjord, you're up.
 TRAVIS: Let's try to finish this motherfucker off. I run right past Jester as she's going, "Shit, shit!"
 
MATT: 30, is as close as you can get right there.
 TRAVIS: Which is not in melee. Damn! Eldritch Blast!
 MATT: You are in its melee range, which means you'll have disadvantage on Eldritch Blast. Knowing that, you can take a step back.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll go one back.
 LIAM: Travis wouldn't, but Fjord would know.
 TRAVIS: That is a 24.
 MATT: That definitely hits. Is it a natural 18?
 TRAVIS: It's a 17. Plus six, 23. Sorry. That is eight plus four plus two. 12, 14, and the--
 MATT: Don't do additional psychic damage, it has to be a melee weapon to do that.
 TRAVIS: Thank you. 14.
 MATT: 14 points of damage. All righty. Fjord, how do you want to do this?
 (cheering)
 TRAVIS: Oh shit! I run up. Stop. Realize how long its arms are. Flip the sword over. Look into the pommel, and fire it into his back, line him up.
 MATT: As the creature pulls its jammed hand out of the ground after trying to strike at Jester it turns around to watch as you approach, and as you hold the pommel outward the blast, lighting up its jaw, its eyes go to a bright pink with fear as it recoils from the blast. As it hits, the blast seems to be absorbed by its blubberous form. This crack starts to (cracking) across its body. It's trying to hold itself together, and the scales begin to turn to ash. Like the inside of it burning out like the end of a cigarette, the embers glowing, incinerating the interior of its body as it slowly tries to hold its body together. It falls to its knees and then slowly the rest of its body tumbles away into ash and dust.
 TALIESIN: There is no body?
 MATT: The whole body doesn't burn away.
 TALIESIN: We need a body!
 MATT: The wound where it impacted is burned up at this point. 
 TALIESIN: Oh thank god. Is that imp still there? Is the imp still active?
 MATT: Two imps are still active, yes. That ends your turn, Fjord?
 TRAVIS: Yeah.
 MATT: That imp is going to go after Nott, who is currently protecting the body.
 TALIESIN: I'm going to Blood Maledict. I'm going to Curse of the Eyeless on that imp.
 MATT: Which one, the one that is attacking Nott?
 TALIESIN: The one that is attacking Nott.
 MATT: Okay, so disadvantage on that one. That puts it at 14.
 SAM: 16.
 MATT: As its eyes cloud over it swings with its stinger and you feel it just barely hit the tip of your hood and pull it back. But no impact from the stinger. One will attack you, Fjord. That is an 18.
 TRAVIS: That will hit.
 MATT: Yeah, it hits.
 TRAVIS: You motherfucker.
 MATT: You suffer seven points of piercing damage, and I need you to roll a constitution saving throw.
 TRAVIS: Copy that. 
 MARISHA: Big money! That’s not big money!
 TRAVIS: That is not big money. I'm pretty sure that is low, because that is a two. Yeah, that is a six.
 MATT: 3d6 of poison damage, that is 14 points of poison damage.
 LAURA: Are you still alive?
 TRAVIS: No, I'm unconscious.
 TALIESIN: Oh for fuck’s sake.
 SAM: From an imp?
 MATT: That stinger is no joke, man.
 LAURA: Wouldn't that be funny if we killed the thing and then died from the imps? That would be so funny.
 MATT: After the creature that summoned it is gone, the imp turns and as it runs toward you, you try and prepare, and its stinger pushes past your leather armor and pierces right through your sternum and poison hits the inside of your system, right where the heart and lungs are and you feel them seize up. Your eyes and sight go to darkness. That ends both imps' goes. Molly, you are up.
 TALIESIN: I'm running at the closest imp. Can I get there?
 MATT: You can get there.
 TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to take two swings.
 MATT: Go for it.
 TALIESIN: For fuck’s sake. Nope. That was a ten.
 MATT: No. You try and swing, the blind rage in your eyes, but the imp whose eyesight you had cursed, hearing you approaching, manages to just get out of your range. Sorry man, that sucks. All right, that brings us to Beau and Jester's turn.
 LAURA: I'm going to turn and say: Oh, help me, Traveler! I'm going to cast Word of Radiance.
 SAM: It's pronounced "verd."
 LAURA: Which will hit both of the imps with 1d6 radiant damage.
 MATT: What is the spell?
 LAURA: It's Word of Radiance. Each creature of my choice I can see must succeed on a constitution saving throw.
 MATT: Constitution saving throw? Thank you.
 LAURA: Of 13.
 MATT: Five and 16. The one over by Fjord succeeds, the one over Nott does not. What does it do?
 LAURA: 1d6 radiant. Six damage!
 MATT: Six points of damage to the one over Nott?
 LAURA: Yeah.
 MATT: That's the one that someone damaged.
 LAURA: Yeah, that's the one he cursed.
 MATT: Yeah, with Vicious Mockery. That's enough to do it. This bright, whitish-blue light begins to burn up its body. As it tries to fly away, you watch its body burn away like flash paper.
 MARISHA and TRAVIS: That is cool.
 
TALIESIN: Can you bonus action anybody?
 LAURA: That was an action.
 TALIESIN: Stabilize someone?
 MATT: No, that's a feat.
 LAURA: As a bonus action can I-- I don't even have a healing potion.
 TRAVIS: There is one on the map.
 LAURA: I'm going to run over to-- oh shit, the imp is still over top of Fjord.
 LIAM: Yes, that is the threat.
 LAURA: I'm going to make my illusion jump down and start charging at the imp over Fjord.
 TALIESIN: That's smart.
 MATT: That ends your turn. That brings us to Beau.
 MARISHA: Once again, there is no way I can break through the grounds and get to this imp, is there?
 MATT: No.
 TALIESIN: You could dash.
 LIAM: You can get there and draw attention.
 TRAVIS: How many imps are left?
 TALIESIN and MATT: One.
 MARISHA: I gave my healer's kit to her, so there's nothing I can do to try and bring the girl back?
 LIAM: You can soak up damage.
 TALIESIN: She has got two more rounds regardless.
 MARISHA: She does. She’s already saved one.
 MATT: Actually I need to make another. Okay, success.
 TALIESIN: Yay!
 MARISHA: Damn, there isn't a lot I can do. I guess I'll run up. Just there. Can I pick up a rock and throw a rock be like: Get! Get on!
 MATT: Sure, we'll call it an improvised weapon.
 MARISHA: Get!
 MATT: You're not proficient. So go ahead and roll a straight attack roll.
 LIAM: In the dark.
 MATT: Yes, with disadvantage.
 MARISHA: Four. 14. I guess that's a four. So ten.
 MATT: You hear it clatter against a tree in the distance.
 MARISHA: Yah! Yah!
 
TRAVIS: Damn trash pandas, get out of here!
 MATT: Caleb, make another death saving throw, please.
 TALIESIN: How are you doing, man?
 LIAM: That’s a success.
 MATT: Two successes. All righty. Nott.
 SAM: Okay, with one hand I will try to cover the bleeding wounds of Caleb, and with the other hand, not even looking, I’ll just fire my crossbow at the other--
 (laughter)
 SAM: At the other imp-y thing.
 MATT: Okay. Go for it.
 SAM: One.
 MATT: That’s what happens when you don’t look!
 SAM: I should’ve looked!
 MATT: All right. Roll one more attack roll for me, please.
 LAURA: Oh no.
 SAM: That’s a six.
 MATT: Six? You hear a (metallic sound) across your shield as a bolt from a hand crossbow almost hits you, Jester.
 SAM: I’m blinded by tears!
 
 (laughter)
 
 TALIESIN: This is-- oh man, one imp is going to kill us all. One fucking imp.
 MATT: All right. Nott, does that end your turn?
 SAM: I mean, I can’t do anything. I can run over to the other thing, but I can’t do anything, so--
 TALIESIN: We have to stabilise Fjord, is what we’ve got to do.
 SAM: And my boy--
 TALIESIN: Caleb? Caleb’s doing okay.
 LIAM: I have two successes. Not that you know that.
 SAM: I don’t know that, but... I’m just staying.
 MATT: Fjord, I need you to make a death saving throw. It’s been a long time since you’ve had to make one of these in the game.
 TRAVIS: Three.
 MATT: That’s a fail. All righty.
 MARISHA: Is that your first fail?
 MATT: Top of the round. The imp-- I’m going to make a perception check for that imp. That's not good enough. The imp is going to go ahead and fly over and attempt to take a swing at your duplicity illusion.
 MARISHA: That's good.
 MATT: Okay. Does anything happen when the illusion is hit?
 LAURA: It doesn't say! It just says for the duration you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space.
 MATT: Let me check just in case.
 LAURA: I have advantage on attack rolls against the creature if we're both within five feet of each other.
 MATT: Okay, yes. So just an illusion. So it strikes and its stinger passes through with no effect and it seems confused and figures it out. So now it knows that it's an illusion, but it wasted its attack that round. Illusions come in handy for that. All right, that ends their turn. Molly, you're up.
 TALIESIN: I'm running right at it.
 MATT: All righty.
 TALIESIN: Let’s try some different dice here. 
 For fuck's sake! I've got to stop rolling that die. This is-- yeah, no.
 LAURA: Both of them fucked you again.
 TALIESIN: 11?
 MATT: 11 does not hit. It's too quick. You swing twice more and it's doing figure-eights around your blades. It's frustrating the shit out of you.
 LAURA: Poor Molly. His arms are getting so tired swinging both those blades.
 TALIESIN: This is so embarrassing.
 LIAM: The dice don't give a shit--
 MATT: All right. Toya--
 TALIESIN: This is so embarrassing.
 MATT: --succeeds on her third death saving throw and stabilizes. No, she's stabilised. A natural 20 is what we'd need to see for the one. All right, so that brings us to Beau and Jester.
 LAURA: Do you want to attack the imp?
 MARISHA: I'll-- yeah.
 TALIESIN: Do you get advantage because I'm engaged with it?
 MATT: No. It doesn't work that way.
 MARISHA: I'm not a rogue.
 MATT: That's right.
 MARISHA: So seeing everyone dodge this thing, I'm just like--
 MATT: I mean, if you're flanking it, I'll allow advantage on the attack. Which is like, as long as you're on the complete opposite side of the foe--
 TRAVIS: There is a convention around the imp right now.
 MATT: So you can-- I'll say you can get advantage.
 LIAM: Everyone's like, "Hey, hey, hey!"
 MATT: Essentially, yeah.
 TALIESIN: Ugh, look at it scoot! God!
 MATT: So yeah, you can if you want to.
 MARISHA: So I'm just going to run up and be like, stupid! I'm going to try and stomp it.
 MATT: So you're going to try and knock it to the ground and stomp on it, is that what you’re doing? Because it's flying in the air. All right, first strike. So attack with advantage.
 LIAM: It's like that video from Ireland. Catch him, daddy!
 MARISHA: With advantage, right? That hits. 15, natural. With my two-handed staff?
 MATT: Yep.
 MARISHA: Wait. I've already hit. Forget that. Forget that! Eight, so 12 damage.
 MATT: All right, so the first attack crushes the imp and it hits the ground, the wings go limp and it's dead, but you still (yells) and stomp down, just crushing it more and more. And then its body eventually just burns away into ash. So all the threats have been neutralised and you now have two friends that are bleeding out.
 LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to run over to Fjord and cast Cure Wounds on him so he wakes up.
 MATT: You come back to consciousness.
 LAURA: With five hit points.
 SAM: I will try to stabilise Caleb using no--
 MATT: Caleb, I need you to make a death save.
 LIAM: Death save? Fail.
 MATT: All righty. Make a medicine check.
 SAM: Natural 20. And I will do mouth-to-mouth.
 MATT: I will say for the purposes of this, you watch as Nott pulls the porcelain mask back and just gives Caleb the most terrifying mouth-to-mouth you've ever seen. Caleb, the darkness fades and you come to consciousness. The first things you notice are the cold temperature, the taste of iron in your mouth, and the vision of Nott pulling away from you like a terrifying Nosferatu. 
 TRAVIS: Oh Jesus! Like Willem Dafoe as--
 LIAM: Caleb goes (yelps), and I cast Dancing Lights into the goblin and light her up! Ah!
 TRAVIS: Even worse.
 MATT: (laughs) Temporarily blinded.
 LIAM: What the hell happened?
 MARISHA: It's like 2am and the lights come on at the club.
 SAM: Ugh, that's what she looked like?
 (laughter)
 LAURA: Oh man, I start dancing around in a circle with my illusion. We did it, guys!
 MATT: You watch as two Jesters start doing a little skip.
 MARISHA: I immediately run to Toya.
 TALIESIN: I was about to say, I'm going to run to Toya and pick her up. I've got her. I've got her.
 MARISHA: Do you-- I've got her. I could hold her, though.
 TALIESIN: I've got her.
 MARISHA: Why--
 TALIESIN: Because you were the last face she saw? I should probably be the first. Thank you. You did the right thing. You don't need to be the first thing she sees. She’ll just start screaming all over again. Thank you.
 TRAVIS: Anything of the toad?
 TALIESIN: We're going to need him.
 LAURA: Oh yeah. I want to go over and start searching his body.
 TRAVIS: I thought it burned away, no?
 MATT: A large part of the torso just burned away. The inside is partially burned out to embers in the blast, but there's still probably 60 percent of the body remaining.
 LIAM: DM, am I at one hit point at this moment? It was zero.
 MATT: You would be at one hit point when you come to consciousness. I'm giving you that because of the natural 20. Any other roll, you would just be stabilised.
 LIAM: True love's kiss.
 MATT: Exactly. (laughs)
 LAURA: Investigation or perception?
 MATT: This is investigation, because you're poring through the--
 LAURA: 14.
 MATT: 14. You find a small pouch of flesh, like a little hiding pouch that you kind of reach in a little bit and it has kind of a mucus-y liquid on the inside. As you reach in, your fingers find what appear to be a few small stones you can feel at the tip of your fingers. Do you pull them out?
 LAURA: Okay.
 MATT: You pull it out. It's a handful of jewels. Looks like rings, necklaces. There's actually a few stolen pieces of jewelry that are in the pouch as well as a few coin.
 LAURA: What? This is awesome. Here, Fjord, I found a cloister of seamen for you.
 TRAVIS: What is it? What did you give me? What is this?
 LAURA: It's a bag of stuff that I think you will like. I already removed all the fancy stuff from it though.
 SAM: So it’s just gooey flesh?
 TALIESIN: That’s definitely a cloister. It’s a nu-gget.
 TRAVIS: That’s foul.
 MATT: But other than that, it is devoid of any other items or objects and it looks like that was its running fund.
 LAURA: Whoa! I put all of the jewels on my fingers.
 MATT: They’re still slick but easy to put on because they’re lubricated.
 LAURA: Nott, look at me.
 SAM: Those are very nice.
 LAURA: Aren’t these pretty rocks?
 SAM: They are very pretty, yes. Where did you find them?
 LAURA: On the bag.
 SAM: On the bag? Can I have one?
 LAURA: Yes, but first, can I use a ritual spell? Does that work against-- Yeah. I can do ritual spells? 
 MATT: You can do ritual spells and it won’t take a spell slot, just takes ten minutes more of casting time to do it.
 LAURA: Can I Detect Magic on it?
 MATT: You may. So you take a little bit of time concentrating on it. At the end of the spell, you send out your extended consciousness, but they do not resonate anything magical.
 LAURA: Hmm, they’re just plain rings, but they’re very pretty.
 MATT: They are pretty.
 MARISHA: What are you going to do with the girl?
 TALIESIN: (sighs) Get her back home.
 SAM: What if she’s evil?
 TALIESIN: I know. We’re going to have a talk.
 LAURA: We should bring her to the--
 SAM: Authorities.
 LAURA: So that she can defend us. So that she can tell everyone that the fiend was bad.
 MARISHA: I don’t know if she feels that way.
 TALIESIN: I don’t know if she feels that way either, but although-- it’s going to take some time, I think. And also, we’re going to need the body, and honestly, only one of us was here. For those at home, I’m pointing at Caleb.
 TRAVIS: Well, why was he the only one?
 TALIESIN: Because the rest of us are under arrest.
 TRAVIS: That’s very true.
 TALIESIN: So congratulations on single-handedly defeating the creature that killed several guards. I’m sure you will be well-rewarded and compensated.
 LAURA: You are a very powerful wizard.
 LIAM: Yeah, you know, ain’t nothing. (coughs) Oh...
 TRAVIS: Yeah, that’s how I feel.
 LAURA: Can I use my healing kit and help heal him? Does that work, or does it just bring somebody back to consciousness?
 MATT: It just helps stabilise. There’s a feat you can take that makes it do more.
 LAURA: Oh really? Okay, cool.
 LIAM: Do you have any anything left in you?
 LAURA: I got nothing.
 LIAM: Well, okay.
 LAURA: I can heal you in the morning.
 LIAM: Or we could just sit here for a bit and I could catch my breath, I think.
 LAURA: We can rest for 30 minutes or an hour or so.
 TALIESIN: Let’s take a rest.
 MATT: All right. As you guys sit here in the quiet, you can hear the crickets now; the rest of the sound of the forest has fallen away and the din of the battle has vanished. The moonlight gets a bit brighter as the moon climbs higher in the sky. And you all kind of look around at each other. Through this haphazard series of events you’ve come to assemble a skillset that seems to overlap pretty well. And hopefully it’s enough to clear your name. But we’ll find that out next week. So we’re going to end the episode. We’ll be back to continue that thread next Thursday.
 MARISHA: But I want to, like, keep going.
 MATT: I know, but it’s 10:45!
 LAURA: I would just like to say that as we’re resting there, I’m closing my eyes and keeping a hand down close to Nott with my rings on my fingers.
 SAM: I’m going to try to take one off.
 MATT: Sleight of hand.
 SAM: Eight-- 26.
 MATT: I don’t even think you have high enough perception at all. You have a very nice--
 LAURA: It was all the mucus on the ring.
 MATT: Yep.
 SAM: I did it.
 (laughter)
 LAURA: I’m so proud of you.
 MATT: Aw. And we’ll leave it at that. All right, thank you guys so much for watching. I’m excited to continue this next week.
 LIAM: Man, I got the full wizard experience tonight.
 MATT: Yeah, you did! 
 (laughter)
 MATT: Oh man. Well done, that’s your first boss fight of the campaign!
 MARISHA: Oh my god!
 TALIESIN: That was so unpleasant.
 LAURA: Good job, Fjord!
 MATT: Two of you went down.
 MARISHA: Does this mean we level up?
 MATT: Well, because we are doing milestone leveling with this campaign--
 SAM: What does that mean?
 MATT: That means there’s no experience points, but at the end of each major story beat, 
like a big moment that I see fit, then everyone will level up together.
 MARISHA: So do you see fit?
 MATT: I will see fit when this arc concludes, so end of next episode, probably, everyone’s going to hit level three. So start thinking about-- for those of you who have to choose a path, think about what you want to do if you haven’t already.
 TALIESIN: I think I’m going to multiclass.
 LIAM: Seven times.
 TALIESIN: Master of none.
 MATT: Not even passable. (laughs) All right, thank you guys so much for watching. Thank you again, DandD Beyond, for being our awesome partner and sponsor for the leg of this campaign. Hope you all have a wonderful weekend, and is it Thursday yet? Have a good night.
 TRAVIS: We lived!
 MARISHA: We lived! Episode three!

Part I Edit 
 MATT: Welcome back. Last we left off, our group of adventurers had found their various individual fates come together here in the city of Trostenwald, where they had attended a carnival that had blown into town, had watched a horrible occurrence happen where one of the older attendees transformed into this terrifying zombie creature. Upon defeating it, you were all put under investigation as possible culprits for the reason that it occurred. In trying to wander the city to investigate and try and clear your name, you eventually found that there was a fiend hiding amongst these carnival workers. This large devil-like toad creature, which through some research you had found to actually be called a nergaliid, had killed two more of the guards, leaving you to fend with their transformed forms, and then fled deep into the center of the Ustaloch Lake.
 (clattering off-camera)
 MATT: Thank you for the punctuation. Upon gathering your supplies after a night’s rest, you managed to, through trade of a bottle of wine, get passage across the lake onto the central island which at one time housed the abode of a witch that had long collapsed. Waiting for nightfall, you approached the grove that existed there in the island and found near this ruin this same fiendish nergaliid as well as Toya, the 12-year-old dwarf girl who had been affixed to him for the performances in the carnival. You did battle with this large fiendish entity who summoned a cluster of imps and managed to knock a few of you pretty heavily to the ground before you finished it off. We left off as you all were finishing licking your wounds, catching your breath, and now as the moonlit night gets its darkest in the sky you figure out what the next step is gathering means of absolving yourselves of suspicion. As you've all now taken a moment to yourselves, you can hear the sound of the nearby crickets getting more and more deafening as the silence crawls over the center of the lake. Toya, the young girl, still lies unconscious. The remains of the devil toad, still partially burnt from the final blow delivered by Fjord, are mostly intact above its shoulders, head, and its legs. What would you like to do? 
 TRAVIS: Ow. We're all fucked up. 
 LAURA: Does anybody need any healing?
 SAM: Oh, are you alive right now? 
 TRAVIS: We're up. Just barely. 
 LAURA: You need some? 
 LIAM: I'm really shabby at the moment. 
 LAURA: Oh, that's too bad because I don't any spells left. 
 LIAM: That's good. Let's go back and talk to the cops. 
 LAURA: Should we do something with this body? 
 TALIESIN: I think we need to bring it. I think we going to need a trophy. 
 LIAM: What about just its head? 
 TALIESIN: That'll do. 
 TRAVIS: It's a big head. It might be all we can take. 
 LAURA: I don't know if it'll fit on the boat. Would it fit on the boat that we came out on? 
 MATT: How much of the body? 
 LAURA: The whole body. 
 MATT: The whole body with all of you could probably fit it. It doesn't have the usual-- you could probably fit it. 
 SAM: How about just the head? 
 MATT: The head it would probably do, but the whole body, I'd have to make a few rolls. 
 TALIESIN: I'm going to give the body a quick search to see if there's anything. 
 MATT: You already did. 
 LAURA: Yeah, I got a bunch of rings. See? 
 TALIESIN: Do I recognize any of these rings? 
 MATT: No, you do not. 
 TALIESIN: All right. That's disturbing. 
 SAM: I got one, too. 
 TRAVIS: Has the head been damaged at all, or is it mostly intact? 
 MATT: It's mostly intact. There are a few gashes on it from the general fray, but for the most part it's still a solid head. 
 TRAVIS: Molly, you've got them impressive swords. You want to do some hacking?
 TALIESIN: Suppose I should. 
 MARISHA: I'd say you have a pretty impressive sword, too. 
 TALIESIN: I'm going to try and carve off the head. 
 MATT: Okay. It's a tough form. Not only is the exterior of its flesh blubbery and a heavy rubber-like substance that is glistening with whatever mucus-like liquid it naturally produces, but then beneath it, the muscle sinew is extremely tough. It takes you the better part of 20 minutes to finally get the head entirely off the rest of the torso. It weighs enough to the point where you're going to need one or two other hands to get it anywhere. 
 TRAVIS: That's an artiste at work right there.
 TALIESIN: This is as far as I go one this one. That's way too heavy for me. 
 LIAM: It's all you, blue. 
 MARISHA: I'll help you out. 
 TALIESIN: I'm going to grab Toya.
 LAURA and MARISHA: (groaning) 
 LAURA: Is Toya waking up at all? 
 MATT: Toya is passed out. You'd have to try and rouse her.
 LAURA: It's probably best not to wake her up while we're carrying this head around. 
 TALIESIN: I think that's a very good idea. 
 MARISHA: Yeah, this is frightening. 
 LIAM: The imps burned away?
 MATT: Yes, they turned to ash.
 LAURA: Does he have hair? What are we carrying him by? 
 MARISHA: Yeah, what are we carrying him by? 
 MATT: Along the brow line there are these small holes that could be breathing holes. You'd have to carry it from there, under the socket, or under the jaw.
 LIAM: Because that's what you want to stick your finger in. 
 TRAVIS: Yeah, totally. The mucus hole. 
 MARISHA: I grab the jaw and I say: "Hey, Jester."
 TALIESIN: I did share meals with this person for two straight years. Never mind. I'm walking away. 
 TRAVIS: We are fucking with his old co-worker. 
 TALIESIN: I'm already walking away. I took the kid and am walking to the boat. 
 LAURA, MARISHA and TRAVIS: Sorry! 
 LIAM: Caleb just retched into the grass from watching that. 
 LAURA: All right, let's carry him. 
 TALIESIN: You're the worst. You're all the worst. 
 LAURA: Fjord, I gave you the bag of skin. Don't forget you have that. 
 TRAVIS: I have it? 
 LAURA: You have the bag of slimy skin. 
 TRAVIS: I'm going to salt it and hang it out to dry. 
 LIAM: If it will help tomorrow or today-- what time is it? It's the middle of the night, isn't it? 
 MATT: You approached just after dusk, so between the slow moving in there, the combat, and the rest afterward it's probably close to 10:00PM.
 LIAM: I know exactly what time it is, don't I? Yeah. 
 TRAVIS: You know exactly what time it is? 
 LIAM: It's something I've always been able to-- why is everybody looking at me like-- (vomiting sound) 
 LAURA: Where's Frumpkin? 
 LIAM: (fwoosh)
 LAURA: Oh, good. 
 MATT: At this point, Molly, as you're ahead of the group and you're making your way through the trees, Toya begins to stir in your grasp. Her eyes open a bit as you're holding her and she looks up at you confused, eyes lulling around in the sockets for a moment before they see you and clarify. "Molly."
 TALIESIN: I know, dear. You've been through a bit. There's been some bad business. 
 MATT: "What happened?"
 TALIESIN: (sighs) A friend turned on us, but it's going to be all right. I'm going to get you home, all right? 
 MATT: "Wait, where's Kylre?" She starts trying to fight your grasp. 
 TALIESIN: I'll explain it later. 
 MATT: She's going to try and break free of your grasp. Are you going to attempt to hold onto her?
 TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. 
 LIAM: How far away are they from the rest of us? 
 MATT: While you guys have been doing all this, he's gone on ahead. He's probably a good 40 to 50 feet ahead. Go ahead and roll an athletics check.
 TALIESIN: You're a monster. 
 LAURA: Oh, no! 
 TRAVIS: Tell me you did it. 
 TALIESIN: No, it's not that bad. 
 LAURA: Oh, it looked like a one from this angle. Still pretty terrible.
 TRAVIS and MARISHA: (chanting) Level two. 
 LAURA: You were rolling bad on this the last game. You need to stop rolling that one. 
 MATT: Yeah, that dice needs to go away. 
 TALIESIN: I've got some new stuff coming in. 
 LAURA: All right. 
 MARISHA: It's coming across the border. It's real good. 
 TALIESIN: Coming in from the Feywild. 
 MATT: You can choose athletics or acrobatics. 
 TALIESIN: Oh. Can I reroll? 
 MATT: No. 
 TALIESIN: Then that's nine. 
 MATT: That still beats her. She rolled a five. All right, wanted to double check. She's scrambling and as you hold her back she tries to fight for a second and then goes limp in your grasp and goes, "I'm scared." 
 TALIESIN: I know. It's going to be a bit rough, but it was for the best. I'm so sorry. Some people just turned, I'm so sorry.
 MATT: "What happened?"
 TALIESIN: He got sick. There was something inside him. There was something inside him that made him do some bad things, but it had to be taken care of. You're going to be all right. 
 MATT: She gets really quiet for a second. You get to the boat and the gentleman you had earlier passed the wine off to is sitting there waiting. He has a small pouch that's opened with some dried meat that he's chewing on as he waits. As you guys walk up, he says: "Oh, I see you've finished."
 LAURA and MARISHA: (groaning) 
 MATT: (shouting) "What in the hell is that?!"
 MARISHA: Move! 
 LAURA: We told you we were having a party, man! 
 LIAM: I was just about to suggest covering that up, but you know, all cards on the table.
 MATT: He grabs his bag of dried meat, pulls it up, and backs up. "I didn't know-- What is that? What did you do? What is that?" 
 MARISHA: I said we were going to be doing some frog digging. 
 TALIESIN: Biggest frog you've ever seen. 
 MATT: There's a pause before this tiny screeching sound begins to emit from Toya. This high pitched and barely audible squeak as Toya begins to *scream*.
 LAURA: I take off my coat and I cover the head with it. 
 TALIESIN: I was trying to keep her away from that.
 MATT: It's hard to keep her away from *that*. 
 TRAVIS: We literally cut the head off Barney and shoved it in her face. (singsong) I love you.
 TALIESIN: The Barney that been raising her, yes. Really take that in. Off to a great start. 
 MATT: After Jester throws her cloak over Toya--
 LAURA: No, not Toya. Over the head. 
 TALIESIN: I'm trying to keep her quiet. 
 MATT: She's sobbing into your arms at this point. You fell her body shaking against your grasp. 
 LAURA: I feel so bad. 
 TALIESIN: You should. 
 SAM: Poor girl. 
 TALIESIN: I'm going to take her to the front of the boat and keep her far away from all that. 
 LIAM: I pull Fjord away for a moment, about ten or 15 feet away. This man in the boat has seen all of you who are supposed to be under house arrest. We cannot have him talking to the authorities. 
 SAM: Should we kill him? 
 LIAM: Jeez! Come here. 
 TRAVIS: I have a good feeling that this guy is a man of upstanding nature. I'm sure he'll keep it to himself. 
 LIAM: Oh, that's very trusting. 
 TRAVIS: Yeah, of course.
 SAM: We gave him one bottle of wine. That's not very much. 
 TRAVIS: We have another bottle. Don't we? 
 MARISHA: Yes? 
 LIAM: Oh, we owe her two now. Great, it's a party. 
 MARISHA: We could also toss him a bit of gold if we think it would make him forget the night. 
 TRAVIS: After all, we came to him, right? I would prefer not to use any violence. 
 LIAM: I'm not suggesting that, but it's either violence or giving him a little something. 
 MARISHA: What makes you think he's going to go talk to the authorities? 
 LIAM: You want to leave it to chance? 
 MARISHA: Who cares? 
 SAM: This is a small town, Beau. Everyone talks to everyone. You taught us that. 
 MARISHA: I did, but everyone also hated the circus. 
 LIAM: Molly, do you want to join this conversation? 
 TALIESIN: I've been listening. I pull out a gold coin. Give him this. 
 LAURA: Maybe one more. Or two more. 
 MARISHA: I pull two out as well. 
 LAURA: I'll pull three out. 
 MATT: He's recessed to the very back of his boat, wide-eyed as you approach. 
 TRAVIS: You're right. Coin is a good idea. 
 LAURA: Go charm him, Fjord. You're very charming. 
 MARISHA: You've got fisherman vibes. 
 TRAVIS: Oh, shit. Wait a minute. How long did that fight take? 
 MATT: You've returned to your normal half-orc form. 
 TRAVIS: Oh, cool. Okay. There was an old man who was with us before. 
 TALIESIN: And now there's a little girl. It's all coming full circle. 
 TRAVIS: Maybe we give him the extra bottle of wine and *you* go talk to him. 
 LIAM: Walking up the boat--
 MARISHA: Here. (clink)
 LIAM: Collecting coin as I go. The thing of it is we have done Trostenwald a great service. There was an unsavory element-- did you know the circus was in town? Doesn't matter. There was a bad fellow-- That’s his head-- with them. It's no fault of theirs. You pick weird folk up on the road in the circus. Isn't that right, Mollymauk? 
 TALIESIN: I'll let that go. 
 MATT: He reaches over, grabs the oar from the side, and lifts the cloak off the face.
 LIAM: That's going to rile you up. That's a bad idea. 
 MATT: "It doesn't look like a savory creature."
 LAURA: It wasn't. Trust us. 
 TALIESIN: Took a lot out of us. 
 LIAM: But the situation in town is a little political. We're going to take this thing out of here and I'm going to report it to the authorities. We don't really want to create a stir and frighten people here. I hope you will take--
 LAURA: We like to be unsung heroes. You know, like superheroes with secret identities. 
 MARISHA: Yeah, we're an underground anonymous activist group. 
 LAURA: Yeah, that helps people. But if everyone knows who we are, it'll be much harder to fight all the crime. 
 LIAM: Try to focus on the gold. 
 MATT: He slowly reaches out and takes it from your hand. "All right. I trust it was a bad thing. So I'm going to take you back, and then you promise I'll never see you again?"
 LAURA: We'll try really hard to not let you see us.
 TALIESIN: If you see us, we won't make eye contact. 
 LAURA: We'll pretend we don't know you. 
 MATT: "That includes the goblin."
 SAM: I was never here. We never had this conversation.
 LAURA: She's a halfling.
 MATT: He glances over and takes a closer look.
 SAM: I'm very ugly for a halfling.
 MATT: "Let's just get back to shore." He grabs the oar, takes the bottle of wine that he had mostly drunk by himself before, and polishes it off in one series of gulps.
 LAURA: Don't boat drunk.
 MATT: As you all gather up onto the ship, he begins to paddle you back towards the western shore of the Ustaloch to the outskirts of Trostenwald.
 MARISHA: When we get to the shore, we should probably split up.
 LAURA: How are we going to get this giant head to the authorities?
 MARISHA: That's a good question.
 LAURA: Oh, I got an idea! Why don't you go get a wagon as soon as we get to shore, and we'll help you load it onto the wagon, and then you just take it on in yourself.
 TALIESIN: It's a shame we didn't just get rid of a wagon not more than one night ago.
 SAM: Why do we need to take it with us? Us traipsing through town with a giant head seems like it would draw focus. Why don't we just put it somewhere and send the authorities out here to find it later?
 TALIESIN: Someone else may get to it, or something might happen.
 SAM: What are they going to do with it? It's a big head!
 MARISHA: We could leave someone with it, and we can just--
 TRAVIS: I could stand guard as a crownsguard next to it.
 TALIESIN: What could people do with the head of a creature like this?
 MATT: What could people do with the head of a creature like this? Who knows.
 TALIESIN: Would I know?
 LAURA: They could make a lot of soup.
 MATT: They could turn it in for-- there's a lot of poor folk here. If they had a large looking odd creature, that's worth some gold.
 SAM: We can hide it. Maybe some of us have skills to hide things.
 LIAM: I think Fjord had a good idea, which is if you can disguise yourself as a crownsguard again, you wait with it. You guys get back to the tavern, yeah?
 MARISHA: You can go and alert the authorities.
 LIAM: Now, here's the thing. I may be speaking out of turn-- I know I don't know you very well, but it feels like the thing that we all share in common here is that we don't wish to make-- maybe not you-- make a big splash here.
 TRAVIS: Agreed. The less attention, the better.
 LAURA: Well, you know, whatever.
 TRAVIS: The less attention, the better.
 TALIESIN: For the moment.
 LIAM: Okay, so maybe I'm 70 to 80 percent correct, but we're all in this together.
 MARISHA: And gold. I like getting paid.
 TALIESIN: We need to get this one back to the circus, too. You might be helpful for that.
 LIAM: I don't want to make a big thing. I'm going to go the authorities, to-- my keen mind tells me that woman's name was--?
 MATT: Oh, the-- sorry.
 LIAM: Yeah, the one who wanted to go eat.
 MATT: Yes, you're talking about--
 TRAVIS: Norda?
 MATT: Yes, Lawmaster Norda.
 LIAM: Norda? I want to go to her and citizen's arrest kind of thing. Keep it quiet, don't need big accolades, will take gold, and then I'll bring that back and we can divvy that up. That's no problem.
 TRAVIS: I like it. As soon as other crownsguard arrive with Norda and the rest of whoever you bring to the scene, maybe I can go with you and help return Toya.
 LAURA: You disappear quickly, because if you get drawn into that investigation, it would be bad.
 LIAM: Right, and if nobody recognizes you-- Do you remember any of the guards that were in town that you could make yourself look like specifically? 
 LAURA: Oh!
 MARISHA: What was that guy's name?
 LAURA: What were the two guards that keep coming to the tavern?
 MARISHA: Oh, wait!
 LAURA: We wrote their names down.
 MARISHA: Jonas and Lucas.
 LAURA: That's right!
 SAM and MARISHA: The Jonas Brothers.
 MATT: They're not related at all.
 LIAM: DM, question.The two zombified back at the circus tents, were they burnt to a crisp beyond recognition?
 MATT: One of them was, and they have been discovered.
 LIAM: Yeah, but was he recognizable? Did we leave him looking like that dude at the end of The Last Crusade after he drank from the wrong cup?
 MATT: With some time, he could be identified.
 LIAM: Okay. Well, the Jonas Brothers it is, friends.
 SAM: Just to game this out. You, Caleb, someone who is not suspected of a crime, is going to bring the severed head of a member of the circus to the police--
 LAURA: No, he's going to go to the police and bring them to the head.
 SAM: Either way. You, Caleb, someone who is not suspected of a crime, is going to point the police to the severed head of a member of the circus with no evidence showing what that thing was or that it was evil, and that will somehow not implicate other people who were not with us at the time. How is this going to prove their innocence, just showing a head?
 LIAM: They already believe that the circus is terrible. I think they were just going to confirm their own suspicions.
 MARISHA: Also, Toya. If she would speak honestly, she would absolve all of us.
 TRAVIS: I think Beau makes a very good point. Without Toya's testimony we're in trouble.
 TALIESIN: I'm hoping Toya will--
 LIAM: Well, that's a sticky situation. Because what if she talks about my friends who were there with me?
 TALIESIN: She knows what to say when guards are asking questions.
 LIAM: It looks like she knows how to go off like a siren.
 TALIESIN: She's had a bad night.
 LIAM: I'm at one hit point, I understand.
 TALIESIN: We'll have a talk. We'll get her to some people who can calm her down and makes sure she remembers how we take care of each other.
 MATT: "If there's something you want to ask me, I'm right here." You're all in this boat as it makes its way across the Ustaloch.
 TALIESIN: Sorry, dear. I was hoping that we didn't have to have this conversation in front of strangers.
 MATT: "Can someone please explain to me what's going on?"
 LIAM: Can you explain to us maybe, your relationship with Kylre? If that was his name.
 MATT: "I mean, that's the name I've ever known."
 LIAM: Let's talk about the killing part, though.
 MATT: "I don't know anything about that. When we did the show the other night, the horrible man--"
 TALIESIN: It turns out that that was-- Kylre did that.
 MATT: “Why?"
 TALIESIN: I don't know why. Something snapped. He's hurt and killed a lot of people. We think that maybe he's been making you sick too.
 LAURA: Have you ever heard him say nergaliid?
 MATT: "No. Where's Gustav?"
 TALIESIN: Gustav is having trouble with the authorities. We're going to need to all work together to save him.
 TRAVIS: Unfortunately, the authorities think that Gustav and the circus are responsible for what happened. Actually, it's just Kylre. He wasn't what you thought he was, I'm afraid.
 TALIESIN: The twins are being the twins, Ornna's being Ornna. But I think we can save everybody. We just need to take care of each other.
 MATT: "He was my friend, though."
 LIAM: Child, how did you grow so close to him?
 MATT: "Gustav put us together for our act and he protected me. I felt safe around him. He didn't let anyone get too close I didn't want to."
 LIAM: Did he communicate with you in some way?
 MATT: "He talked."
 LIAM: What did you talk about?
 MATT: "Well, we talked about everybody else in the family. We talked about how I missed not having a family. He didn't talk about himself much, but it was mainly just little games."
 LAURA: Did he teach you how to sing to affect people's minds?
 MATT: "No. That was how I got by before I met these guys."
 LIAM: I am sure this is painful for you. You are young. Sometimes people we feel we know can be someone else. Regrettably, this is one of those instances. He was a dangerous thing. It is very important that this is buried here. You want to travel on with the circus and with Mollymauk and your friends. That thing tried to kill us. It did kill things in Trostenwald. Who knows what it would have done to you, child.
 MATT: Make a persuasion check.
 LIAM: Oof.
 SAM: It's good.
 LIAM: No, it's not good.
 TALIESIN: I felt it.
 TRAVIS: It's Sam good.
 LIAM: It is only a six. Rolled very low.
 MATT: As you're talking to her, her eyes keep flickering off of your face and over towards Beau. You watch her curl back into herself and get quiet.
 TRAVIS: It might do for you to apologize.
 MARISHA: Sorry.
 LAURA: Sorry for what, Beau?
 MARISHA: Really, Jester?
 LAURA: Really.
 TALIESIN: No, I want to hear this too.
 MARISHA: Sorry for choking you with my stick.
 TALIESIN: Somehow that was better than what I was hoping for.
 LIAM: Rated T for Teen.
 SAM: And I'll never do it again?
 (laughter)
 MARISHA: And I'll never do it again. As long as you don't try that again, of course, I guess.
 LAURA: It was only because Kylre was trying to kill us and she was afraid that you were helping him.
 MARISHA: Yeah, I wasn't trying to hurt you. I was just trying to get you to stop singing. But it was so abrasive.
 TALIESIN: You know how people outside can be. The mean girl was just afraid of you and we're going to let her go on this one.
 MATT: "I'm tired."
 TALIESIN: Yeah, I know. Let's get you home, okay?
 MATT: She leans into you, Molly. After a few minutes, she falls asleep against you.
 LAURA: That went well, I think.
 TALIESIN: Choked you with my stick?!
 MARISHA: I did.
 LAURA: She apologized for exactly what she did.
 TALIESIN: That was certainly memorable.
 MATT: "All right, we're here." The boat hits the edge of the dock. He hops off and pulls the rope up. Slowly manages the boat over the side of the dock, ties it up.
 LAURA: How many people are around the dock right now?
 MATT: There's no boats at the dock that are being manned currently. There are a few boats out on the water that you saw in the distance. There are some night fishermen. There's nobody immediately in the vicinity.
 TRAVIS: Okay, I'm going to hop off the boat and break eye contact with the captain of the boat so that I can Disguise Self into a crownsguard.
 LIAM: I talk to him while you do that. You have your wine, you have your gold. Thank you very much, it is much appreciated. It was a lovely trip.
 MATT: "Yes that's fine. Just, please, get out of my boat."
 TRAVIS: (English accent) Who goes there? What is this, what have you brought?
 LIAM: Oh, I have felled a beast.
 MATT: "They got in my boat. I-- they--"
 TRAVIS: Are you responsible for this?
 MATT: "No. They took over my boat and forced me to take them over to the middle island there."
 LIAM: You will not take credit for my kill. I have killed this thing and I want it to be watched. I am going to the authorities. We will bring them back and get this sorted.
 TRAVIS: It's a horrifying looking creature. You are to be commended for your bravery. Lawmaster Norda will want to know about this immediately.
 LAURA: You weren't here.
 MATT: Make a deception check with advantage.
 TALIESIN: This is so weird.
 LAURA: I'm just holding a bowling ball.
 TRAVIS: 21. No, 20.
 MATT: He goes, "I want nothing to do with this. Good night." He helps each of you quickly get off the boat. Ties and locks it up and makes a beeline--
 SAM: (shouting) We'll come to your house with your share of the reward.
 (laughter)
 TRAVIS: All right we can't waste any time.
 LAURA: Can I lob the head up over the side of the boat?
 MATT: Make a strength check.
 LIAM: Monster calves.
 LAURA: Oh no.
 SAM: You're strong though.
 TALIESIN: Are you?
 LIAM: Yeah, but at level two you need to roll higher than a three.
 LAURA: Eight!
 MATT: You get it partway up and it begins sliding back into the boat and plops into the boat and goes (bouncing) and you have to catch yourself.
 TRAVIS: Tongue and mouth just (lolling).
 MATT: It's terrifying.
 LAURA: All right I need help. It's still covered, don't worry. She can't see what we're doing, it's covered with my cloak.
 SAM: I'll help you.
 LAURA: By the way it's a little tiny cloak. It's like a half cape so it's like--
 TALIESIN: It's like a napkin on a buffalo.
 MATT: A doily on a couch.
 SAM: I'll help you.
 LAURA: It's going to squish you.
 SAM: That's all right, I'm strong. One, two, three!
 MATT: Eventually you guys get it up onto the dock.
 LAURA: Oh, that's good.
 TRAVIS: Molly, do you intend to keep Toya here or do you need to take her back?
 TALIESIN: Take her right back. No one can know that she's been anywhere.
 LIAM: That is correct. Take her and sequester her with the family so not a peep gets out.
 TALIESIN: We'll explain to her what needs to be done.
 MARISHA: How do we trust y'all won't skip town in the middle of the night?
 TALIESIN: We still have people in the lockup.
 LAURA: Gustav's in jail still.
 MARISHA: So?
 LAURA: Some people are loyal.
 TALIESIN: I'll be back and I have to show back up with you people anyway. I'm going to get her as quickly as possible.
 MATT: The rest of you guys are doing?
 LAURA: Who is not very stealthy here?
 TRAVIS: I'm keeping watch over the toad head.
 MARISHA: I have a plus six to my stealth.
 TALIESIN: I wouldn't say no to it before I take off.
 LAURA: Oh that's true, you're sneaking back to the carnival. I give you a nice little blessing.
 LIAM: You're going to stay with your new friend. You can't come to--
 SAM: I'm not coming with you?
 LIAM: Not this time. It's not-- you know why.
 SAM: What if you're in trouble? You're very hurt. You've had a terrible night.
 LIAM: If any problem should arise, I'll send Frumpkin straight away to you.
 SAM: Unless you're dead. No one's going to be around to save you if you get into trouble.
 LIAM: I'm almost dead already.
 SAM: Yeah, that's not good.
 LAURA: That's not comforting, Caleb.
 LIAM: Nott, this is what I talked to you about the other night. These are our friends and we're going to sort this out and figure out what we do next. It has been you and me, now it is you and me and them. Okay? You're with your blue friend here.
 LAURA: You can hold my hand.
 LIAM: I'll be back. I'm just going to have a conversation. We have gotten out of prisons before, you and I. I'm not worried about that.
 SAM: Her hands are very warm.
 LAURA: I'm warm blooded.
 LIAM: Well, she was just holding the frog head.
 SAM: Oh god.
 LAURA: Nott, you were too.
 SAM: That's true. But I didn't have my fingers in the holes.
 LAURA: Should I leave my cloak here over the head, sir, good sir, guard man?
 TRAVIS: It's fucking me, right? We know it's still me. I'm right here.
 MARIASHA: We're not RPing still?
 TRAVIS: No.
 MARISHA: Sorry.
 TRAVIS: You can do what you want.
 LAURA: Should I leave my cloak here or should I take it with me?
 TRAVIS: Sure, I'll make a dramatic flourish with it.
 LAURA: Just make sure you bring it back home.
 MARISHA: I feel like the cloak is identifying to you.
 TRAVIS: Take it with you, scratch that. Good idea.
 MARISHA: Like where did this really pretty pink and lavender cloak come from?
 LAURA: It's green.
 MARISHA: I'm sorry, green. I haven't looked at the art.
 SAM: It's nighttime, the moonlight makes everything sort of look purple.
 TALIESIN: That's canon.
 TRAVIS: All right, go quickly.
 LAURA: Okay, we stealth away.
 TALIESIN: What is my stealth bonus now?
 LAURA: You just get advantage.
 MATT: We'll get to you in just a second. The rest of you guys make a stealth check, please.
 LIAM: I don't need to cause I'm just taking a stroll.
 MATT: Nope. For those of you who are--
 MARISHA: Ten total.
 MATT: That's ten.
 LAURA: Seven.
 SAM: 26.
 LIAM: Yep, that's my girl.
 MATT: Okay, before we get to you. As you guys make your way back to the Nestled Nook Inn, you come to the intersection where the alleyway leads you back to the rope where you originally let down, was placed. The rope is still there, in the darkness. As you make your way into the alley a voice goes, "Excuse me." The three of you glance over and you see a crownsguard at the end of the alley that's currently there with his arms crossed. "Can I help you?"
 LAURA: Is my back to him still?
 MATT: He's to the side. You guys are all looking up at the rope now and he's to the right of you.
 LAURA: Is it still dark out?
 MATT: Yes. It's close to midnight at this time.
 LAURA: Oh my god. Has anybody seen my shoe that I dropped earlier around here?
 MARISHA: I immediately drop to my knees and start looking for a shoe.
 TRAVIS: What, what?
 SAM: Did you say a shoe?
 MATT: I would like for you to make a-- (laughs)
 TRAVIS: You turned into Mr. Rogers?
 SAM: A shoe!?
 MATT: I would like for you to make a deception check, with disadvantage please.
 SAM: My shoe!
 LAURA: Eight.
 MATT: As Beau's on the ground frantically searching for a shoe and Nott's there in the darkness, the guard with his arms crossed goes (whistles). He begins to walk and approach you as two more guards close off the other side of the alley and they begin to come up to you guys.
 TRAVIS: How far away are they from me? Too far?
 MATT: Too far.
 MARISHA: Drop one of those rings, drop a ring!
 LAURA: It's not a shoe! I drop a ring. Wait, did we take a short rest when we were on the boat? We did. It was a short rest on the boat.
 MATT: To get across, I would say I’d allow a short rest.
 LAURA: Okay, I'm going to cast Invoke Duplicity. Behind the guard.
 MATT: Make a sleight of hand check to see if they notice you suddenly casting a spell, or a spell-like effect.
 LAURA: Please please please. Natural 20!
 (cheering)
 MATT: Okay, so you Invoke Duplicity. Another version of you appears behind one of three guards. What are you doing?
 LAURA: Oh God. Oh, she doesn't make a sound, does she?
 MATT: Let's double check this new ability that I'm getting used to.
 LAURA: I don't think she makes any noise.
 MARISHA: Can she tap?
 LAURA: But if she can cast through her, then I can imagine she can make contact because she casts on touch.
 MATT: You create an illusory duplicate of yourself. It is an illusion, it cannot make actually physical contact with anything.
 LAURA: Well, if she's behind one of the guards then two of the other guards can see her.
 MATT: Sure.
 SAM: We took a short rest on the thing?
 MATT: I'll say on the boat across the river, sure.
 SAM: If you want to hit dice it up.
 TRAVIS: You can roll one hit die. He's rolling commando. He don't want it.
 MATT: Anyway, you Invoke Duplicity and you appear behind him.
 LAURA: Yeah. My duplicate is going to jump up and down and start flailing her arms and then run down the alley around the building.
 MATT: Okay.
 SAM: We have to kill these fucking guards, don't we.
 MARISHA: No.
 MATT: The guard sees something quickly dart into the shadows and continues walking towards you.
 LAURA: Oh, come on!
 MARISHA: Just go with it, go with it.
 LAURA: Did you see that behind you?
 MATT: The guard approaches and goes, "It seems that you have been out and about when you were supposed to be within the inn."
 MARISHA: Found it! The ring.
 LAURA: That's my ring. I dropped it out the window.
 SAM: She calls it a shoe, it's a shoe ring.
 LAURA: I like to wear them on my toes.
 MATT: Three more guards have now approached from the front of the building and they approach and begin pulling out manacles and chains and say, "We're going to have to take you to the stockade."
 LAURA: Oh, please don't. Really, we just left the building because we wanted to go--
 MATT: You're being locked up right now, as we speak.
 LAURA: This is the stupidest thing!
 MARISHA: So stupid!
 TALIESIN: Level two!
 SAM: Do I have to go, too?
 MATT: Oh yeah.
 SAM: But I was just a bystander! I was walking down here and I saw these, these two ruffians and I was going to go get help.
 MATT: Make a deception check.
 LAURA: It's actually true, she wasn't with us.
 SAM: Zero.
 (laughter)
 TRAVIS: You rolled a zero?
 LIAM: Look at him!
 TRAVIS: What's your modifier, negative two?
 SAM: Three minus three is zero.
 MATT: That went into my nose.
 TRAVIS: Brave new world.
 MATT: As you're telling him this, your mask goes (creak). He goes, "Arrest that creature!"
 TALIESIN: We're going to die from bad paperwork.
 MARISHA: Yeah, we really are.
 TALIESIN: Literally, we're going to die from bad paperwork.
 MATT: You both are put in chains. You're put in chains both arms and legs.
 LAURA: Oh, that's just mean.
 SAM: Racism!
 MATT: They bring you over to the stockade. Mollymauk. I need you to make a stealth check with advantage.
 TALIESIN: 13.
 MATT: You guys slowly make your way through the low grass over towards where the outside of the carnival is. As you approach, you can see there is about five crownsguard that are making rounds around the outside. It looks like where previously they had been keeping watch over the people that were there, since the murder of two of their own, it has heightened the intensity of the watch. It looks like it's fairly well watched. You get the sense, at a distance, that you would have a hard time getting in there. You can try and sneak her in and sneak out, but it seems dangerous.
 TALIESIN: Oh, shite. Not even a good push to get her underneath, just back into one of the tents, or no?
 MATT: You can try.
 TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't know they're caught, do I?
 MATT: No, you have no idea.
 MARISHA: Let's all get caught.
 TALIESIN: I'm going to try and wait for an advantageous moment.
 MATT: Which I'm going to allow you to do. You stay outside of the outskirts of the torchlight at the very front of the tent and the back of the tent. The fire of the actual encampment has gone out because you don't see any other carnival members. The sisters ran. They fled. You don't see any sign of Desmond or Ornna. Make one more stealth check, the two of you, with advantage because you still have the ability. You're at the cusp end of it though.
 TALIESIN: Ooh. 22.
 MATT: You manage to pace yourself, just carefully wait for the right moment, dart out of the grass having her under your arm and she's like, "What? Why? What is going on?"
 TALIESIN: You remember. Nothing happened. Find Ornna. You didn't see me. You just hid and waited and you didn't know that anything was wrong. If people ask, unless you hear from me, you don't know anything.
 MATT: "Okay." You slip her into the tent and back out, none the wiser.
 TALIESIN: I'm going to start heading back to the inn.
 MATT: Okay. You go back to the inn. You two. You're just waiting?
 LIAM: No, I'm not waiting. I'm going to see Norda, so I'll see you shortly. Be ready.
 TRAVIS: You will.
 MATT: Okay. You make your way to the stockade. As you approach and make your way into the interior, the two crownsguard at the front say "Hold. What's your business?"
 LIAM: Excuse me, and I lurch and prop myself up against a wall and push back. Excuse me. I just had a very harrowing night.
 MATT: "Have you been drinking?"
 LIAM: You get me Norda this very minute and I will tell you what has happened with this circus and in this town and don't keep me waiting another minute. I'm bleeding out here. Arschloch.
 MATT: Make an intimidation check.
 TALIESIN: Nice.
 LIAM: Oh, come on.
 MATT: Just keep it in the--
 LIAM: I wish I had gone with that because it was great there but it's not great here. That is a nine!
 MATT: It is indeed. He sits there and glares down at you for a second. You're posturing, this filthy, scruffy man in a coat that wandered up out of nowhere covered in a little bit of his own blood. He just looks down at you for a second, "Sorry. She's done for the night."
 SAM: They keep regular hours here.
 LIAM: Excuse me. There are very good people being held under house arrest in a tavern right now. They are innocent. I have evidence that I can show her. This whole thing can be solved now.
 MATT: "This whole thing can be solved first thing in the morning. I'll let you sleep it off. Have some water. Come back when you're feeling a little more yourself."
 SAM: Kill them all.
 TRAVIS: I draw back, and flames burst forth!
 LIAM: Okay. I look him in the eye. I will go away. Get the message to her that the head of the circus frog is at the docks, waiting for her inspection.
 MATT: At this point, you hear a voice on the inside, just like, "Good night, good night" and a cloaked figure exits the front doorway, roughly about four and a half foot tall.
 LIAM: I remember the height.
 MATT: Norda is off the clock and is currently leaving for the evening to return to her home.
 LIAM: (shouting) There is a circus toad's remains at the docks! I would like to put this town's fears to rest. I am looking for-- What's her name? Yorda.
 ALL: Norda.
 LIAM: Norda. Yorda's at the inn. Right?
 MATT: There's Norda and then Yorda because I like to make it as confusing as possible.
 LIAM: Liam's memory is really spotty, but Caleb's is rock solid.
 MATT: It's funny. When you spell things on paper, they seem so much different and when you say them out loud they're like, “Ah, they're very similar.” The figure stops and turns and you hear this audible (heavy sigh). The figure waddles over towards you and pulls the hood back and it's Norda. "All right, what's this about a frog head?"
 LIAM: Thank goodness. Thank you, gentlemen. Forgive me, I can see that you're trying to get yourself home to bed.
 MATT: "That would be preferable, aye." You see bags under her eyes. She's had a long day, her hair's a bit frazzled, and she looks like she's waiting for you to finish.
 LIAM: You are aware that there are people at the Nestled Nook under house arrest by your order? They are innocent and I can prove it, and I would like to end things as quickly as possible. I have killed one of the circus folk this evening.
 MATT: "Now this'll be real interesting." She looks past you, and you follow her eyeline, and there you hear the sound of chains as a handful of crownsguard with Jester, Beau, and Nott, in manacles, approach from behind. "These ones, you're talking about, right?
 MARISHA: Help. Help. Help.
 (laughter)
 LIAM: Funny story. Yes, these are the people I was talking about. Nothing has changed, however, and I am only asking to take another ten minutes of your time to walk to the dock. One of the performers has been killed this evening, and I have done it. I staked out the circus because my friends were in trouble, and wrongly accused, and I knew this. So I staked out the circus this evening, and watched as this toad thing left the grounds there. It did this to me, and I, in a rage, followed it and destroyed it, and I will show you the remains of my work. We'll put it to bed. I'm either a clown or I'm a toad-killer. Let's see what it is.
 MATT: Make a persuasion check.
 LIAM: Come on, you fucker.
 LAURA: Oh, goddamn.
 LIAM: 11.
 MATT: She goes, (sighs) "Hold onto them for just a moment." She walks back inside. A moment passes, and she returns with four other guard.
 LAURA: I keep doing this so I can make a jingling sound with my chains.
 LIAM: You know, that's probably agitating the issue. Let's go to the docks.
 MATT: She comes up. "All right. Drag them along with us. Show us what this thing is, and if what you say is not true, you'll join them. How's that sound?"
 LIAM: I'm good with these terms. Follow me please.
 MATT: "All right."
 LAURA: You know, the only reason we were out of the inn is because we were looking for you, Caleb. We didn't know where you went.
 LIAM: I am not going to answer her. I'm just walking very firmly, with purpose, to the docks.
 MATT: It has been close to an hour at this point.
 TRAVIS: If I can clock that, I would like to leave the head, move off into the shadows, and assume my older man form.
 MATT: Using your second slot.
 TRAVIS: No, I can just drop--
 MATT: Oh no, you can do this whenever, that's right.
 TRAVIS: I'll drop the crownsguard, and make the old man and sit so I can keep an eye on it, but away from it.
 MATT: Eventually, you guys are led up to the docks, where you guide them.
 LIAM: Moment of confusion-- here it is, right here, where I left it. Nobody has tampered with it. I turn around and I pull back my clothing and show a huge slash across my body, and say: You see this? It was done by this thing. (whoosh)
 MATT: As soon as you pull back and reveal the face, its jaw is relaxed now, its muscles have sat now that it's been left in the dock, and its pooled at its base. This old pumpkin  look. Its tongue's lolling out and unraveled on the ground, with what remained within its salivary glands has soaked the remaining wood around its base. One of the eyes has rolled back, but it's a horrible display. The guards take a step back immediately at the reveal, and Norda immediately gets interested, gets close, takes a look at it, and begins prodding a bit with her finger.
 LIAM: It is as bad as it looks, and if you have any holy people in this city, they will confirm that this thing is fiendish.
 MATT: (sighs) "You say it's a fiend? Because what this looks like, is you just murdered one of our possible witnesses and/or other members of this investigation, so I'm hoping this is a fiend. I don't know fiends."
 LIAM: I hope you don't believe that I slashed open my own body and then went to the police.
 MATT: "Honey, I've been doing this for a long time. I've seen stranger. Hold on just a second." She calls one of the guards over, whispers to him for a second. He rushes off. "Just so happens we someone in town who might be able to confirm this for us, might help your case."
 LAURA: Who is it? 
 MATT: "Oh, they will be here shortly." 
 LIAM: I sit down on a crate and I stop talking.
 MATT: Okay, and this awkward period of time with the guards, all just standing there, holding you as you wait patiently. Some of them are tapping their fingers. You start rattling your chains and two guards pull the chains taut so you can't do it anymore. Mollymauk as you begin to make your way back into town, because you're making your way through the dock district along the lakeside and you look up ahead, and you can see there's a couple of torches being held by crownsguard right where the head was left, and you can see Caleb, and then three of your allies in chains. 
 TALIESIN: Hmm. (Sighs) 
 LAURA: Oh no! What are you going to do?
 TALIESIN: I'm going to get a little closer.
 MATT: All right, make a stealth check, please. You do not have advantage anymore, that has passed. It's been more than a hour. 
 TALIESIN: Just to take a look at what is actually going on.
 LAURA: Not to get too close. 
 TALIESIN: Not too close.
 MATT: Yeah, it's not a high DC.
 TALIESIN: 19!
 MATT: You get a little closer, you are still maybe a good 100 feet or so away from them, keeping to the shadows along a building, keeping low. Thankfully it's nighttime, it's pushing midnight at this point. Because you're ostentatiously dressed, but there isn't a lot of light in your colors. As far as you know right now, no one can see you, you're too far away to hear much, but you can keep an eye on them. 
 TALIESIN: Oh what's the play? Ah! I'm going to-- Yeah, fuck it. I'm going to walk up. 
 MATT: All right.
 TALIESIN: With briskly. There I find you! You're not supposed to leave the bloody inn you-- Oh. (Sighs) They’re already in trouble, apparently. 
 MATT: "I love when they do this! Chain him up." You are shackled as well.
 TALIESIN: All right. Less questions to answer.
 MATT: At this point, Norda is starting to smile a bit. She's like "Man, if we could have more criminals like you lot, my job would be far easier. I would get home a lot earlier."
 SAM: We're not criminals! We're not! Me and Caleb were just travelling ever since we broke out of that-- Nothing! 
 TALIESIN: Dance number. 
 LIAM: No, it's good that you try so hard to protect the rights of giant frog creatures. I'm very impressed. 
 LAURA: Fiend creatures specifically. 
 MATT: At this point the guard that had left earlier, who has been gone for about 15 to 20 minutes or so, comes back with a brisk jog. There's another figure walking up behind him, also jogging. You can see light gray hood and cloak around and as the figure approaches into the torch light, pulls back the hood, and you see this long shoulder length curled blond hair. A very very delicate looking elven male, who approaches. "I believe I've been summoned, Norda?" "Yes sorry, this is Archivist Zeenoth. He's been in town for a few days and he comes from the library that knows a lot about a lot of things. I hope that he can help us in this. Zeenoth, they’re calling this thing a fiend. What do you know about this?" He steps closer, kneels down next to the head 
 TALIESIN: Xhorhas. 
 MATT: Hmm?
 TALIESIN: I just whisper Xhorhas. 
 MATT: "Yes, these creatures do frequent Xhorhas." He gives some look over, pulls a small book out of his side pouch. He has to thumb through it, compares a few things. "I'm not a specialist, unfortunately. This creature is very much a very dangerous entity from the far east. I'm surprised it made it this far into civilization before being destroyed. It's a good thing it has been." He now gets to look at everyone, over the crew and goes, “Are you the ones who slew it?”
 LAURA: Oh well technically it was Caleb, technically. 
 LIAM: Just me.
 MATT: As the figure looks over and stops on Beau and kind of smiles. 
 SAM: What's going on over there?
 MARISHA: Oh sorry, I just have back issues. I'm just stretching.
 LIAM: Yes it was difficult, but I prevailed in the end. The city is safe. What library was that that you mentioned?
 MATT: "Oh I'm an archivist. I'm the archivist of the Cobalt Soul."
 LIAM: Here in town?
 MATT: "No, I'm from Zadash. I'm a bit out of my depth at the moment."
 LAURA: What brings you this far?
 MATT: "Well, I have business." At this point Norda goes, "All right you know what? This is some serious bullshit. We're all just chilling here at the docks, we have confirmed that's a fiend."
 LAURA: The nergaliid!
 MATT: "A negaliid! Bring them back to the stockade. Let's have a trial." They begin to pull you guys back to the stockade. Two of the guards grab the nergaliid head and they begin dragging it along, and you guys are all being pulled.
 LIAM: Oh sorry, one last thing, Watchmaster. I pull out the book that I read about the nergaliid. Here this is a gift, for you. This is folklore. You will find I have marked a page in there. It will describe this thing. 
 MATT: As you guys are walking, she thumbs through and finds the page, begins to read, passes it to the archivist. He begins to read it. He passes it back. You guys all make your way into the stockade. You're not brought to her chambers, you're brought to a much larger room. This room has much more of a stark, barren, stone interior. There are benches built. There is a central kind of a pit. There's about four or five steps down into this pit. Then above that is a desk where Norda takes as the law master. As you step in you realize, oh this is a room of judgement. What are you doing? 
 TRAVIS: I would like to try, once they start making their way back to that facility, to quickly make my way to the inn, if I can as the old man, enter, make my way into the restroom, drop my disguise, come back out as Fjord. Oh the water closet, what have you.
 MATT: There is a shared water closet.
 LIAM: It’s just a pot.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, the room with the pot in it. Then make my way back to the front door, stick my head out where the guards are. 
 MATT: Yeah, there's two guards still posted there. Most of them have already left because they’re carting off the rest of your friends. 
 TRAVIS: Please, I can't seem to find any of my comrades. Have you seen where they have gone? 
 MATT: They look at each other. "Yeah, they've been arrested."
 TRAVIS: I was afraid as much. Could I make my way down to where they are being held? I would like to be present, if it would be prudent. 
 MATT: "You leave our watch, we cut you." They both flank you side to side and push you ahead a little bit. They are glued to your right and left. 
 TRAVIS: Very kind of you. 
 MATT: They lead you to the stockade. As you guys are brought into this chamber, Norda sets up. 
 SAM: Who is going to go get the little girl? 
 LIAM: You're the little girl here. You're confused. It's been a night. 
 MATT: Norda, up there at the top, takes her cloak off, puts on her ceremonial armor bits. There's a whole element to the presentation of this. You can see her tiredly putting them on. Sets her hands on the top, "I would like you to present what evidence you have to absolve you of these charges against you and then based on what you present, I'll decide whether or not you're innocent or guilty or require further investigation. Who would like to present evidence first? You! You brought the head of a creature! You're not in chains. We'll start with you." They drag the creature’s head forward. She takes the book from the archivist. "And speaking with Zeenoth here, it appears what you said is true. This creature is a dangerous, terrible fiend. And looking at it's apparent ability to feast on the essence of creatures, this explains both the transformation of the old man. This also explains destruction of our two guards, who were recently discovered. Rest their soul. So, that explains that. Convince me as to why you were not working with this entity, especially those of the carnival." She snaps her finger again and you watch as Gustav and Bosun are brought into the chamber, as well as a third figure who you see step out of the shadows. Her hair dark and fading to white, last seen fleeing into the distant fields, you see, in chains as well, Yasha being pulled into the courtroom.
 (cheering)
 TRAVIS: Showing up just to get arrested!
 MARISHA: Welcome to the club!
 LIAM: (singing) Breaking the law, breaking the law!
 TALIESIN: Lot of help you were!
 MARISHA: Welcome to the chain gang.
 ASHLEY: Hey. Yeah.
 MATT: "That one was caught fleeing from the scene."
 ASHLEY: No, that's completely a misunderstanding of things. That's not what happened.
 MATT: "I'm certain. You have a trustworthy face. What's the next bit of evidence you want to present, please? Anyone?"
 LIAM: Well, first a question. Are you familiar with Occam's Razor?
 MATT: "What?"
 LIAM: I figured. Okay. That one works for the circus. Do I look like I work for the circus?
 MATT: "Strangely, not well dressed enough."
 LIAM: No. I'm a dirty hobo and I reek like yesterday's garbage.
 MATT: "I wasn't going to go that far, but I'll admiss it."
 LIAM: Yeah. This one, does he look like a circus performer? Is he filthy like me?
 LAURA: He's not here.
 MATT: "Which one?" Fjord has not arrived yet.
 LIAM: But he's right here! Look, I can touch him.
 MATT: We'll say for the purposes of that, as you say that and reveal your hand, Fjord enters through the door like it was a planned arrival.
 SAM: Weirdly, he's dripping wet.
 TRAVIS: Baby oil.
 LIAM: The sardonic one, right? With the shit-eating grin. Does she look like she works for the circus?
 MATT: "I don't know what she works for, but I don't trust her."
 MARISHA: That's smart.
 LIAM: I am injured within a centimeter of my life. This one is a nincompoop.
 LAURA: Wait, which one were you pointing at?
 LIAM: That's you. I pull the mask away. This is my good friend. She's a goblin.
 SAM: A little halfling girl!
 MATT: At this point, you watch her pull back.
 LIAM: I step in front of her. She is my friend and colleague and you will not lay a hand on her while I am standing here.
 MATT: Make a persuasion check.
 LIAM: Fucking right I will. That is an 11. (chanting) Level two!
 MARISHA: (chanting) Shitty dice!
 MATT: Her eyes are chained onto this goblin.
 LIAM: She's looking into my chest because Nott is behind me. I'm sorry, I'm confused why you're going to such lengths to defend the rights of this large, oversized frog skull.
 MATT: "I defend no rights of this creature! I've been in this office long enough to know that there aren't usually solo workers on something like this. I know these folk. They all protect each other. Who's to say this wasn't their whole reasoning for coming anyway, and something went wrong, and they're letting him take the fall?"
 LIAM: There's a big conspiracy to make undead crownsguard here in the city?
 MATT: "I don't fucking know! Don't tell me how I do my business! Sit the fuck down! Who's next?"
 TALIESIN: You're right. We do protect our own. That's absolutely true.
 MATT: "Let him up." They loosen the chains and you get to stand and approach a bit.
 TALIESIN: It's a common tactic. It's a good way to make your way through this world. Normally it works. We assumed, the circus, anyway, that we were being framed. We were protecting our own. Is the head in here?
 LAURA: Yes.
 TALIESIN: This one showed his true colors, and then we took care of it. I'm going to throw one of my swords down on the ground that is filthy with its blood.
 MATT: "All right. Why did this one run?"
 ASHLEY: Well--
 SAM: (high-pitched) I mean--
 ASHLEY: I feel like I didn't need to be in there anymore. You know. I don't-- ugh.
 MATT: I would like you both to make persuasion checks. 
 ASHLEY: I feel like--
 TALIESIN: Oh, shit. 12.
 ASHLEY: 11.
 TALIESIN: We needed someone on the outside. We knew we were innocent. We knew you didn't think so. We just assumed you were going to have us all executed and we didn't do anything. What would you have done? 
 MATT: "Is that goblin pissing in my court?"
 (laughter)
 SAM: I'm sorry! I'm really nervous! 
 TALIESIN: In his defense, it's a wonderful vintage. Her defense. 
 SAM: I'm very nervous. I'm sorry, it's just your guards shackled both my wrists and my ankles and I can't move to get into a good position. 
 LIAM: You know, when she's nervous she aerates her bladder, all right? 
 SAM: Look, I have some evidence to submit. Look at my hands and also the hands of Jester. We're covered in the thing's blood. We were there too. We helped the killing of the creature. 
 MATT: The dwarf woman, Norda, leans forward and looks you dead in the eyes. "I've known friends I grew up with who were carved down by your kin. Convince me why I shouldn't hang you tomorrow."
 SAM: I'm sorry for your loss. Where are your people from? 
 MATT: "Grimgolir.”
 SAM: That's not where my clan's from. I had nothing to do with it. My clan operates far, far away and--
 MATT: "Where does your clan operate from?"
 SAM: I’m looking on the map. Near the Felderwin Tillage. 
 MATT: "That's not too far. Maybe we'll send some folks to pay a visit to your clan."
 SAM: You can. Feel free. I'll even tell you where they are. I'm no longer associated with them and I can help you hunt them down if you'd like. 
 MATT: Make a persuasion check. 
 MARISHA: Wow. 
 LAURA: What is it?
 SAM: One. 
 LAURA: No, but you didn't roll a one. He rolled a four. 
 SAM: It's not a natural one. 
 LAURA and TALIESIN: Not a natural one. 
 LIAM: Still sucks. 
 MATT: (sigh)
 LAURA: God, why are we rolling so bad? 
 MATT: She leans back. "I want to sleep. I think you're telling the truth. Most of you. Archivist, does this resonate with you as well? Does this check out, lore-wise? I don't know what the fuck you do." The Archivist is like, "I believe based on what they've stated, at least it's consistent though I'm a bit confused as to the demeanor of the goblin. It's not unheard of to have goblin kin turn against their own. There have been a number of historic individuals of various monstrous races who have been beneficial members of society."
 LIAM: I invite Nott up to my piggy-back position on my shoulders. 
 LAURA: You can't, she's chained up.
 LIAM: I scoop her up. 
 SAM: This is even more awkward. Just put me back down. Put me back down. 
 LIAM: Just let it happen. 
 SAM: No! The chains are pulling me one way and you're pulling me the other way. Just come down to my level! Come down here! 
 MATT: "Bring the two others forward." They bring forward Gustav and Bosun. "This your circus, right?" He goes, "It is my circus and I take full responsibility for what's happened. Sincerely. They have done nothing wrong. They are completely innocent. I brought this creature into our fold and that is on me. Whatever judgement you have, bring onto my head, not theirs. Please. I implore you." "Fine. I'll consider the investigation closed. You're all freed of charges against you. Including the goblin."
 SAM: Oh! Thank you! I would kiss you if I could. 
 MATT: "I would not recommend trying. Okay. Gustav, what's-- I can't read your last name. You've been given quite a debt for Trostenwald so you shall remain here until you've worked off the debt to the city. To the number of 2,645 gold pieces. To make up for the deaths of our two crownsguard, of the two civilians who have died, and the general cost of this entire investigation We'll consider what your work is to the city tomorrow. However, the rest of you: you're free to go. I'm going to go get myself some sleep.”
 LIAM: Can I have my book back, please? 
 MATT: Takes her armor off. "(sigh) All right. I'm going to get a drink." She puts her cloak on and then hops off. With the imposing sight of her on top of a large pedestal and desk, she hops down to her natural dwarven height and it's almost adorable to watch her just skitter the hell out of there. She's done. 
 LAURA: Where are you getting a drink at? 
 MATT: There's no response. 
 LAURA: Do you want company? 
 TRAVIS: I just turn to the nearest crownsguard and--
 MATT: The chains are removed. They free everybody, including Gustav, but two guards are assigned to him to keep an eye over him. 
 MARISHA: As soon as Beau gets out of her chains, I grab my stuff and I leave. 
 MATT: Okay. As you are exiting the stockade, in the archway of the doors right outside, you see another figure standing hood up-- like a short hood with a mantle that stops about midway. Bare arms and dark skin, baggy gray pants and is there, waiting. 
 MARISHA: What's the mantle? 
 MATT: You don't recognize any details about it. You see a cloaked figure there, waiting, looking right at you. 
 MARISHA: Is he blocking the doorway?
 MATT: Is just beyond the doorway. It's not blocked. 
 MARISHA: Is there another way out? 
 MATT: I mean, you can exit. They're just on the other side of the door. Every other way in, you don't know the stockade well and all of it just leads further into the stockade. There are other crownsguard inside. 
 MARISHA: Okay, I'm just going to try and just bolt through.
 MATT: You're just going to bolt? Full run?
 MARISHA: Not run, just you know, Irish goodbye. 
 MATT: Okay. All right. As you briskly exit and turn to the left, the figure intervenes and side steps right in front of you. 
 MARISHA: Do I recognize him? 
 MATT: No. You don't see much of the face. The hood is up and a little bit of the moonlight is coming, you can see the edge of features. The body is muscular, but thin. Looks not terribly masculine or feminine, but it looks able and it moved at a very quick speed to intercept your positioning. 
 MARISHA: I just go: Oh, fuck! Turn around and walk back in. 
 MATT: Okay. 
 MARISHA: I'll join everyone else. I flick off the guy on my way back in. 
 MATT: Okay. As you guys are being escorted out of stockade, Beau comes back in and joins you. 
 LAURA: I thought you left. 
 MARISHA: Just had to pee. 
 LAURA: Oh. 
 TALIESIN: Shame. 
 LAURA: Hey, you guys, we're town heroes! What's it feel like? 
 MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah! 
 LAURA: Yasha, it's very good to see you again. 
 ASHLEY: It's good to see you guys, too. 
 SAM: Where did you go? Were you on a lam for a long time? 
 ASHLEY: I have a little bit of a problem with authority and I didn't want to be caught in a small and confined space and then that ended up happening.
 LAURA: How long have you been in there? 
 ASHLEY: Immediately after I ran away. They sent out horses. I'm not that fast, but I did fuck up a few of the guards. “By accident. “
 MATT: As you say that, you hear a couple (clears throat) and two of the crownsguard visibly bruised that are escorting you guys out into the night air before they eventually leave you to your own devices. 
 TRAVIS: Molly, what do you think this means for the carnival? 
 TALIESIN: I don't know. That is a question.
 LAURA: I mean, if Gustav has to stay here then who's going to run it? 
 MARISHA: That's a lot of gold. That's like a life sentence worth of gold. 
 LAURA: Well, I mean--
 TALIESIN: Gold comes, gold goes. 
 LIAM: How much do you think the circus has? 
 TALIESIN: I don't know how much the circus has and honestly, I think Ornna would lie about it if we asked. 
 MATT: The crownsguard have pulled away and now, it's just you guys and Bosun and Gustav now, out in the air and Gustav is rubbing his wrists. "Well, thank you everyone for helping. That could have been a lot worse. And, you know, it's fine. I know it's a lot of money, but shouldn't take me more than a few years. It's a nice town! Trostenwald is a nice town!"
 TRAVIS: It's not that nice. 
 MATT: "No, it's not but you know, it's better than prison." 
 LAURA: There's a lot of beer here. 
 MATT: "That there is. I may have to start a small fund for that on its own."
 LIAM: What happens to the circus because you know, you can't do the same show for the same people for a year?
 MATT: "Where's Ornna? Where's the twins? Where's--"
 TALIESIN: Well, the twins buggered. Ornna? God only knows. 
 ASHLEY: Where's Toya? 
 TALIESIN: Toya is back at the circus, bit shaken. Very shaken. 
 MATT: At which point, Gustav just begins making a beeline for the circus. Bosun goes, "Oh." (sigh) 
 TALIESIN: How hard can it be to make 2,000 gold? 
 MATT: "I don't know how much he saved. Nowhere near that much, probably." 
 TALIESIN: How hard can it be to steal 2,000 gold? 
 LAURA: I don't know how many people around here have that much. Although, the breweries might.
 TALIESIN: Maybe be best to find that gold elsewhere. 
 ASHLEY: Wait, so, who killed him? 
 MATT: Gustav has spun around and is back and is like, "Sincerely. I appreciate the aid, but don't. This is on me. I'll take care of it. This is not your responsibility. It's not your responsibility. You guys have already done so much. It's fine. I'll take care of it."
 TALIESIN: Suppose we should take a look at what's left at the circus. 
 MARISHA: Can I go take a look around? Do I see Zeenoth anywhere? 
 MATT: Make a perception check. 
 MARISHA: Oh, goddamn it, it was almost better. It was almost good. Ten. 
 MATT: Ten? You don't see anybody immediately around. 
 LAURA: Was that Archivist Zeenoth that outside?
 MARISHA: Archivist. 
 LAURA: That's what I said. Was that who it was that was like--
 MATT: No, Zeenoth was still inside the court when you were leaving. 
 MARISHA: Yeah. Different guy. 
 LAURA: Oh, who was it that was outside? 
 LIAM: We don't know, we didn't see him. 
 TRAVIS: It's very late, right? 
 MATT: Yeah, it's post-midnight now. 
 LAURA: I'm so tired. 
 TRAVIS: Don't suppose you want to retire for the evening. Share a drink together now that this is now somewhat behind us. 
 TALIESIN: I will definitely drink. I think we should probably drink at our camp then. We're fine inviting them. 
 MATT: "Tell you what. As a thanks, we'll grab Toya. We'll meet you guys-- where are you all staying? 
 MARISHA and SAM: The Nestled Nook. 
 MATT: "We'll come meet you at the Nestled Nook and I'll get a round for you all. As a thank you." 
 TALIESIN: Is this a human thing to-- never mind 
 LIAM: Yeah, we're just like tieflings, we're all alike. 
 TALIESIN: I know. 
 MATT: "All right. Bosun, come on." They make their way off to the carnival camp. 
 ASHLEY: It was him? 
 TALIESIN: Kylre went bad. Maybe he'd already always been bad, I don't know. 
 LAURA: I mean, he attacked us. A lot of guards, too.
 SAM: He was an evil fiend. When he joined the circus, who brought him in? 
 TALIESIN: Let's not be throwing words around. 
 SAM: No, he was literally an evil fiend.
 LAURA: He summoned imps. 
 TALIESIN: He did summon--
 LAURA: He summoned imps, Yasha!
 TALIESIN: Something set him off.
 SAM: He controlled the girl!
 TALIESIN: He was fine for years. Something set him off.
 LIAM : Ah, he said it himself, you people in the circus are weird, right? So, every once in a while, a glitch.
 MARISHA: A glitch? What?
 TALIESIN: He was fine for so long. There was nothing for so long. Why? Things don’t just...
 MARISHA: I still think there’s something creepy about this lake, man.
 TALIESIN: Maybe?
 MARISHA: It gives me the heebie jeebies.
 TALIESIN: Everything gives me the heebie jeebies.
 LIAM: Well, if it is this thing that we’ve read about in the book, then perhaps he needed to feed more or was impatient for some reason?
 ASHLEY: What’s happened with Toya?
 TALIESIN: Shite.
 ASHLEY: How is she?
 TALIESIN: She is not good. She is taking it as you would expect.
 SAM: Also Beau crushed her windpipe.
 TALIESIN: That’s true. With her stick.
 LIAM: And, I’m sorry, are we also taking the bouncer into our little coven of weirdos. Is that a thing that’s happening?
 ASHLEY: Oh, well--
 TALIESIN: Always.
 ASHLEY: I mean, I kind of go on my own, but--
 MARISHA: Yeah, she’s one of us.
 TALIESIN: She’s the charm, she has to come!
 LIAM: I’m too tired to argue. Let’s get that drink.
 TALIESIN: See, charm. Drink.
 MATT: As you make your way back to the Nestled Nook Inn, within the tavern, and within the next hour or so, Gustav and Bosun, Toya and Ornna all come in and join you. You guys crowd a few tables together, and under what is generally a pretty empty tavern this night, you guys, for the most part, dominate the center space.
 TRAVIS: I’m sorry, Yasha, for new patrons, you’re going to have to surrender your sword.
 ASHLEY: (laughs) You’re very funny.
 TALIESIN: He is very funny.
 LIAM: That is a very sick burn.
 MARISHA: Speaking of swords--
 LAURA: Careful Fjord, we haven’t been healed yet, you know. She could take you down.
 ASHLEY: You could always try to take it.
 TALIESIN: Arm wrestle.
 TRAVIS: I could, couldn’t I?
 ASHLEY: Yeah.
 MARISHA: Arm wrestle!
 ASHLEY: You do look pretty strong. I mean, you’re just a little bit bigger than me, but I still think I could probably take you.
 TRAVIS: Looks could be deceiving.
 MARISHA: Arm wrestle! Bets on Yasha.
 LAURA: Do it! Arm wrestle!
 TRAVIS: I just thought it would be a nice gesture.
 LAURA: To arm wrestle?
 TRAVIS: No, to give up her sword.
 ASHLEY: What about your sword?
 TRAVIS: Oh, I’m a paying patron here. They know me *quite* well.
 TALIESIN: So? You’ve got to be putting something on the table, though. Well, if you want to surrender the sword or not surrender the sword.
 TRAVIS: Did you want to stay in that room any longer, Molly?
 TALIESIN: (laughs) Never.
 MARISHA: I don’t know what we’re talking about anymore.
 LAURA: I don’t either.
 TRAVIS: Let’s get a drink.
 MARISHA: Are you guys going to arm wrestle?
 TRAVIS: No.
 MARISHA: Okay. How about “Boulder, Paper, Shears”? Wait, what is it? “Boulder, Parchment, Shears”!
 TALIESIN: That’s a stupid game.
 SAM: I never heard of that game.
 ASHLEY: I think it’s something that kids play. I have a better version of that game. We can play it later.
 MATT: The rest of the carnival in presence, Gustav goes and orders a round of drinks to all of you and then sits down. Toya still looks a bit shaken, but seems to be comforted with the rest of the family around her, that still remain at least. Desmond’s come and joined as well. As you’re all sitting together for a bit, there’s a moment of quiet as you’re all sipping, and just tiredly thinking over the events of the evening. Toya breaks the silence, “Is the family going away? Am I going to be alone again?” Ornna looks over at her and goes, “Not if I can help it. It’s you and me, kid, against the world.” Bosun pats Ornna on the shoulder and says, “Well, if you’d have me, you can probably use a strong arm.” Ornna looks back at him and Ornna and him have had this rivalry tension for a while. She goes, “You know what? Sure. The trio makes for a strong pack of performers. Desmond, are you in?” And Desmond is just sitting there, staring into his cup and goes, “I see a new family before me. And one I fear that’s a story I could only spoil. No, I thank you, but I’ll find my own path.” And he just sits there kind of quietly in this somewhat sad space. He gives a brief pat and side hug to Bosun before standing up and leaving. Gustav stands up and looks around. “I’m sorry for everything. For all the pain this has caused you, for all the pain it’s caused you.” Looks at Toya, “For all the pain it’s caused you, little one.”
 TRAVIS: We had quite the adventure, actually. I know people were hurt, but that was really something.
 MARISHA: And apparently, nobody really cared about Enon, so that’s, you know, good for your conscience. 
 MATT: “Everyone’s conscience is heavy with its own reasoning.”
 TALIESIN: Get no blame from me.
 MATT: “I appreciate that. We are our own worst enemy, are we not?”
 TALIESIN: Ah, cheers to that!
 LIAM: I catch Nott’s eye and silently mouth the word ‘lunatics’.
 SAM: Yeah, yeah.
 MATT: “Well, I think that’s the end of my carnival.” (laughs)
 LAURA: It was such a good carnival.
 MATT: “It was a good run! It was a really good run.”
 MARISHA: Man, we caught the last show, you guys!
 TALIESIN: Not our best show.
 LAURA: I liked it.
 SAM: The tickets are probably worth something!
 MARISHA: They might! 
 TRAVIS: Closed it down.
 TALIESIN: You have plans?
 ASHLEY: No, I’m just going to float around like I usually do.
 TALIESIN: I don’t know, I’m thinking about it. I don’t know where I’m going to end up now.
 MATT: “You can go with Bosun and Ornna, if you like. You guys are still carrying on. I mean, I’m not going to keep the tent, I’m not going to keep the supplies. I might hock some of it to try and pay off my debt, but-- take what you want. Start anew. It’s my gift to you.” They all kind of, “Thank you very much. We’ll start small, I don’t think we need too much of the ensemble. How we began, back up in Shady Creek.”
 LAURA: I mean, I could use a really large tent. Like the biggest one? I would take that off your hands.
 TALIESIN: The biggest one’s a bit--
 TRAVIS: What would you do with a really large tent?
 LAURA: I don’t know, I could open up a hotel? Or I could make a bunch of dresses. Or--
 SAM: Out of the tent?
 LAURA: Yeah!
 TALIESIN: You could make a lot of dresses out of that tent. That's fair.
 LAURA: Yeah, right? It’s really pretty fabric.
 TALIESIN: Thank you.
 LAURA: (gasps) A hot air balloon!
 TALIESIN: I don’t--
 LIAM: A what?
 SAM: Those aren’t invented.
 LAURA: Haven’t you seen airships?
 SAM: No!
 LIAM: They generally run from crystals. I’ve seen that kind before.
 LAURA: Yeah!
 LIAM: Yeah, there’s no balloons, though. What’s a balloon?
 MATT: They have simple dirigibles, but they’re not very functional.
 LAURA: Yeah, it just involves fire you guys. We can figure this shit out.
 LIAM: Oh, a dirigible? Dirigible I’ve heard of, but a balloon? I don’t know what that is.
 MARISHA: Have the airships made it to this continent yet?
 LIAM: You don’t know.
 SAM: I think, Jester--
 LAURA: I’ve seen airships, okay? I’ve seen them.
 SAM: Jester, I think it’s safe to say that this first case is closed!
 LAURA: (gasps)
 SAM: So we could open some sort of private investigation service.
 LAURA: That’s what we should do! 
 SAM: Out of a tent.
 LAURA: Let’s not open it here, though. This town sucks!
 TRAVIS: Yeah, we were still planning on moving on after this.
 MATT: “Bosun and Ornna, you guys can use that tent, right?” “Yeah, I think we’ll take the tent.” “All right.”
 SAM: Aw, they took the tent.
 LAURA: Aw. We waited too long!
 SAM: You got to jump on the tent when it becomes available.
 LIAM: You know, just out of curiosity, what’s everybody plan to do now?
 SAM: Well do we have to leave? I mean I’m not wanted anymore.
 LIAM: You were never wanted. Back to my question--
 LAURA: Fjord and I are going to try and get him into the Academy.
 TRAVIS: Well, I wanted to find out more about the Soltrice Academy, yes. I didn’t know what direction you were heading. I never even asked what you were doing here in the first place.
 MARISHA: Oh, you know, I’m just doing a walking tour? Through the continent, just kind of--
 TRAVIS: A walking tour?
 MARISHA: Yeah, just like a backpack vacation, you know? Just stretch my legs a little bit. Meeting some fine people. Discovering myself.
 TRAVIS: Are you on a vacation?
 MARISHA: Yes.
 TRAVIS: Bring a lot of money with you for that vacation, did you?
 MARISHA: What’s it matter to you?
 TRAVIS: I don’t believe you’re on vacation. Where are you going?
 MARISHA: (laughs) That’s your problem. So, you guys going to take off or do you guys want company or-- ?
 MATT: Gustav finishes the drink and goes, “Well, I’m going to go get some sleep and try and figure out how to put my life together. I bid you all a wonderful night--”
 LAURA: Gustav, wait! Here. And I take off one of my rings. This is an old family heirloom, and I hope it can help you pay some of your debt. 
 TALIESIN: I want to spy the rings on her hand, by the way, really quickly.
 MATT: “Looks just like the one I lost off my pinky.”
 LAURA: Well, that’s so weird that you and my family have the same looking ones.
 MATT: “That’s wonderful, thank you so much.”
 LAURA: You’re welcome.
 MATT: “That’s very sweet.”
 TALIESIN: I want to look at the other rings she picked up, not that she’s wearing right now.
 LAURA: They’re right here. You can get a look at them!
 MATT: They’re all over her fingers.
 TALIESIN: They are obviously rings from random dead people, aren’t they?
 MATT: Yeah.
 TALIESIN: Okay. I’m just putting that together.
 LAURA: I play dinosaur fights.
 MATT: Gustav puts his hat on. “Yasha, be safe, and punch anyone who gets in your way.”
 ASHLEY: I will.
 MATT: “Mollymauk, I hope you find what you’re looking for.”
 TALIESIN: I think I will.
 MATT: “To the new family, don’t make the same mistakes your forefathers did. The rest of you, thank you.”
 LAURA: (whispers) He said forefathers.
 SAM: (whispers) That’s progressive.
 (laughter)
 MATT: “I bid you all adieu,” and he exits.
 LAURA: What are you looking for, Molly?
 TALIESIN: Hmm, I’m not quite done with this one. We’ll see.
 ASHLEY: Toya.
 MATT: Bosun and Ornna stood up and Toya is there, “Yeah?”
 ASHLEY: What are your plans? What do you want to do?
 MATT: “I figure I’ll just move on with Bo and Ornna and make a new show. Something with a little less death. That’s what I’d like.”
 LAURA: You should make your way to the Menagerie Coast. I think you guys would have a lot of success in Nicodranas.
 MATT: “I haven’t been to Nicodranas.”
 LAURA: It’s *beautiful*.
 MATT: She looks up and tugs on the side of Bosun’s sleeve. “You know, I actually haven’t been there either.”
 LAURA: They’re always looking for good performers. You would do well.
 MATT: “Hmm. Let’s go ahead and make our way. That sounds like a nice change of pace, and this empire is getting a little stuffy for me anyway.”
 MARISHA: I’ve bend down to Toya, and I take off one of the little jade bangles around my wrist, and I say, “Here. This will keep you safe from assholes named Beau. Except for that asshole, named Bo. He’s a good Bo, but all other assholes named Beau.”
 MATT: You watch as Ornna elbows him and is like, “Oh, no, he’s an asshole too. It’s fine.”
 TALIESIN: It’s true.
 MARISHA: Sorry. Sorry again about that.
 MATT: She takes it and goes, “It’s okay. I know you did what you had to. But when I’m older, I’m going to get you back.”
 MARISHA: You better.
 LAURA: Your first nemesis!
 MARISHA: My first nemesis!
 MATT: Is a twelve year old girl!
 (laughter)
 MARISHA: I give her a little chin (weak punch sound).
 TRAVIS: She goes unconscious.
 (laughter)
 MARISHA: Aw, why? No!
 MATT: The three of them stand up and give a nod, wordlessly look over the rest of you with a smile of thanks, and Bosun looks to you and makes eye contact and goes, “Take care, brother. It gets tougher for us up north.”
 TRAVIS: I’ll keep that in mind.
 MATT: And they all leave the inn.
 ASHLEY: I mean, I’ll say it. I don’t know if you will, but I think that little girl is creepy.
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: Oh no, she’s had a thing the entire time. There was a little while I thought she was in on it completely.
 ASHLEY: Yeah.
 LAURA: I mean, she might have been.
 TALIESIN: I’ve known her for years. I just assumed that she was in on it.
 LAURA: She could’ve been in on it, and just got right away with it.
 TALIESIN: Yeah. That would be great.
 LAURA: She’s good.
 MARISHA: For her, yeah, I mean I got to give it to her, yeah.
 TALIESIN: You know, no matter what you pick, you’re always welcome, right?
 ASHLEY: Yeah.
 TALIESIN: Wherever you end up.
 ASHLEY: Maybe for a little bit, but I’ve got some things I need do, so.
 LAURA: Do you guys want to travel with me and Fjord?
 ASHLEY: Where are you going, again?
 TRAVIS: Up north. Northeast to the Solstrice Academy.
 LIAM: Straight there.
 TALIESIN: Northeast. I've always wanted to go there.
 ASHLEY: Where's... where northeast?
 LAURA: Um...
 (chuckles)
 SAM: We're here.
 (laughter)
 MATT: Well technically, you don't have a map.
 SAM: Oh, no.
 LAURA: We should really get a map, you guys. I haven't spent a lot of time in this area and I don't really know where we're going.
 TRAVIS: We're kind of going from town to town and asking as we go. Afraid we don't know too much.
 LAURA: I wonder if there's a place-- maybe at the general store? They would have a map? Or do you have to go to a map maker?
 TALIESIN: Traditionally, you have to go to a map maker.
 MATT: Traditionally but it can depend.
 TALIESIN: We might have a bit of something at the circus, I don't know.
 ASHLEY: I would love a map.
 LAURA: We'll go looking for things tomorrow. We can go shopping.
 ASHLEY: Okay. We'll go shopping with you.
 LAURA: Yeah.
 MARISHA: Where are you guys heading off to? Seems like people are making pretty big plans.
 TRAVIS: There's safety in numbers, you know?
 LIAM: Yeah. Took the words out of my mouth.
 LAURA: Nott, don't you want to travel with us, too?
 SAM: Um, is she coming?
 LAURA: Yeah, she just said she was.
 ASHLEY: Oh, are you scared of me?
 SAM: A little bit. You're very big.
 ASHLEY: Well, I thought you were Nott, the Brave?
 SAM: Oh. No, there's no comma.
 LAURA: (laughs)
 SAM: I'm just Nott the Brave.
 (laughter)
 LIAM: I don't know. You know, Nott and I have been travelling together for a while and two is better than one, although still very difficult.
 MARISHA: How long ago was it that you guys broke out of prison?
 LIAM: Uh... you know, it was six months ago, about. Five, six months ago.
 MARISHA: Damn, you guys are doing good.
 TALIESIN: Insight check.
 MATT: Against--
 TALIESIN: Five or six months ago.
 MATT: Yeah.
 LAURA: Oh, that was so close.
 TALIESIN: 14.
 SAM: You have to roll, don't you?
 LAURA: Yeah.
 MATT: Roll either persuasion or deception. You can choose. Don't--
 LIAM: I'll do persuasion.
 MATT: I mean, you don't have to say but you did. That's fine.
 LIAM: That's uh, I don't know where on my character sheet is. That's also a 14.
 LAURA: Oh.
 MATT: All right, so seems on the level.
 TALIESIN: All right.
 LAURA: (laughs)
 TRAVIS: Broke out of prison? That's very impressive.
 SAM: Well, it was mainly Caleb. We had to get out. I mean, it was a bad place.
 LAURA: Were they going to kill you?
 SAM: We would have died, for sure.
 ASHLEY: But you guys were there together? Because you knew each other before?
 LIAM: Well, first of all, she's being modest. It was not just me at all, I could not have gotten out of there without you. I don't think you could have gotten out of there without me either but you know.
 SAM: That's true, for sure.
 LIAM: That's why I said two. Better than one. One is the loneliest number.
 LAURA: That you'll ever see.
 LIAM: Yeah.
 MARISHA: There's nothing wrong with being alone.
 LIAM: You know, normally I wouldn't feel comfortable talking about shit like this but you are all very shifty.
 LAURA: I'm very trustworthy.
 TALIESIN: Thank you.
 LIAM: No, no, no, you're shifty as well. Yeah.
 TALIESIN: It's true.
 TRAVIS: In the short time we've spent with you, you seem to be very upstanding folks. I'm sure it wasn't for anything too serious.
 LIAM: No, nothing serious at all, really. I was too curious. She was maybe a little thirsty. You know, petty stuff.
 SAM: But they treated us very badly and we needed to get out of there.
 LIAM: We all know how this country works.
 MARISHA: And where was 'there'?
 TRAVIS: Yeah, is there anywhere we should stay away from on our travels?
 LIAM: (clears throat)
 SAM: Any place is-- I mean, we've been travelling around a bit but--
 LIAM: You know, I wouldn't go west, maybe.
 TALIESIN: Northwest.
 SAM: I'm told east is bad too. There's monsters.
 LIAM: Yeah and they're pretty terrible in the north. That's no secret.
 LAURA: So we go south?
 SAM: Oh no, not south.
 (laughter)
 ASHLEY: It just depends where in the south, actually.
 TALIESIN: I'd be happy keeping a bit of a low-key existence.
 LAURA: Well, I mean we are vigilantes so it's best if we, you know, have our secret.
 TALIESIN: Some of us are a bit sketchy with the law.
 MARISHA: Yeah.
 LIAM: Mollymauk, you're comfortable leaving the circus? You are very-- you have a lot of flair.
 TALIESIN: Well, I figured if you're going to live your life, you're going to live your life.
 LAURA: (jingling)
 TALIESIN: Does do that. There's nothing wrong with living your life. You only get one of them, or mostly. And your days are going to be the days that you're going to have and I'd like to keep living my life the way I'd like to and keep off of certain radars.
 MARISHA: Cheers to that.
 LAURA: Yeah. Life does need things to live.
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: Stupid phrase.
 LIAM: That doesn't make any sense at all.
 TALIESIN: Really stupid.
 TRAVIS: Who said that?
 LIAM: I mean, it does but it blatantly obvious and simplistic.
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: That's just ridiculous.
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: That felt so good. That's catharsis.
 TRAVIS: Yasha, anywhere that we should avoid for you?
 ASHLEY: You know. I'm just-- I'll make my way wherever we go and maybe I'll not stay with you the whole time but I don't like, you know--
 TRAVIS: Being confined.
 ASHLEY: Yeah. I don't-- groups and things--
 MARISHA: Are you claustrophobic?
 ASHLEY: Uh, no.
 MARISHA: You mentioned the smaller cramped space in the cell. Just curious.
 LAURA: Clamp space?
 MARISHA: Clamps-- clampy space.
 TALIESIN: Clam space.
 ASHLEY: I like to have my freedom.
 LIAM: I mean, technically this is a group. You mean groups bigger than this group or is this group too claustrophobic for you or-- ?
 ASHLEY: No. I don't mean it like that. I just want to make my own way sometimes.
 MARISHA: Not tied down to anything but that cloak, am I right?
 ASHLEY: (chuckles) Yeah, that's right.
 LAURA: Speaking of cloaks, mine smells really bad.
 SAM: It was on top of a head. Ugh, that's really gross.
 LAURA: I'm going to go try to find somewhere to wash it.
 MATT: Upstairs at the end of the hallway is a communal washroom. You can find space there.
 LAURA: Hey Caleb!
 LIAM: Yeah?
 LAURA: You know what's upstairs?
 (laughter)
 LAURA: This place where I'm going to go wash some stuff. You could use it.
 TALIESIN: You smell fine.
 LAURA and MARISHA: (chuckles)
 SAM: I like you just the way you are.
 LAURA: You're bloody now, too, in addition to being stinky.
 TALIESIN: You should probably get that patched up, actually, though. That is fair.
 LIAM: (clears throat)
 MARISHA: Yeah, I actually feel like you're starting to get a rash.
 (laughter)
 LIAM: Yeah, I'm good, thank you.
 (laughter)
 TRAVIS: Damn right.
 (laughter)
 MATT: All right.
 SAM: Well, I suppose we should all go to sleep and then if any of us are here in the morning, we'll set off together?
 TRAVIS: That seems fair.
 TALIESIN: I'm all right with that. Collect our things from-- my things, anyway, from the circus. There should be some spares.
 LIAM: Do we have time to-- look at this, we're making plans with friends, that's amazing. Do we have for errands in the morning? I have a couple stops. Nothing major.
 TALIESIN: Take me a while to pack.
 LIAM: Yeah.
 MARISHA: You guys want me to tag along with you?
 TRAVIS: If you weren't too anxious to run off anywhere.
 MARISHA: (chuckles, clears throat) No. I'm free on my backpack tour. No plans.
 TRAVIS: Right. Any sightseeing we should schedule along our way?
 MARISHA: Maybe avoid Zadash just because I just came there, you know. Don't want to hit the same place twice.
 TRAVIS: Zadash?
 MARISHA: Yup.
 TRAVIS: Keep that in mind.
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: Note, note, note.
 MATT: As you guys are all finishing your drinks and standing up to leave the table, a familiar voice pipes in from the centre of the tavern. "Beauregard?"
 MARISHA: (groans)
 MATT: And the Archivist who was there earlier during the trial in the stockade. "It's been difficult to find you. Do you mind if we speak?"
 MARISHA: Hey, Zeenoth! Hey. It's been all of about twenty minutes since I've seen you last.
 MATT: "Yes, um, would you walk with me? I believe we have much to discuss."
 MARISHA: Okay.
 MATT: "Don't worry. She'll be returned to you. Just--"
 TRAVIS: You all right with this?
 MARISHA: It's cool. I've got it.
 TALIESIN: We don't care. We're not that attached yet.
 LAURA: (laughs)
 MATT: "All right then. This way please, Beauregard."
 MARISHA: (sighs)
 MATT: The elvish man gives a bow and he seems jovial.
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: More mine, more mine!
 MATT: Beau leaves and you guys are able to go about the rest of your evening to rest however you see fit.
 LIAM: Way up after Nott has gone, I go over to Norda. Is Norda down there?
 SAM: Yorda.
 LIAM: No, there's two people with rhyming names.
 MARISHA: Yorda is the bartender.
 MATT: Yorda is the bartender.
 LIAM: This is revenge for Vex and Vax. I find the purveyor of the establishment.
 MATT: Yorda.
 LIAM: Mork from Ork, that's what I said.
 MATT: "Right, what can I help you with?"
 LIAM: Excuse me, is there-- I know you have a bath here, but is there a hot bath place like a bathhouse? I'm bruised over every inch of my body and I'm in a lot of pain.
 MATT: "Right, that'll probably be in the Hillsward. It's a bit pricey, but I don't know if it's open this late."
 LIAM: I know, but how much are we talking about?
 MATT: "Oh, I'd put it maybe somewhere in the neighborhood of five silver for a bath."
 LIAM: That's expensive.
 MATT: "But you get bathed like proper, multiple people bathing you."
 LIAM: Northward, you say?
 MATT: "No, Hillsward."
 LIAM: Okay, good.
 MATT: "I mean, no offense to you. Their clientele is a bit, upper class."
 LIAM: I'm not worried.
 MATT: "Alright, fair enough."
 LIAM: Danke. And I head up there.
 MATT: Okay. Beau, as you exit with Zeenoth. As soon as you step into the night air, a second figure flanks your other side. The hooded figure from earlier that had caught you.
 MARISHA: I just look at Zeenoth and go really? Is this really necessary?
 MATT: "It is only because it's been so difficult to find you. I had to call in a favor. Please, come with us. We have a warehouse.”
 MARISHA: Do we have to with this guy? He fucking-- look at him. He looks shifty.
 MATT: The head turns to you in the hood and you see dark elvish features. A bald head as the hood comes back. What looks to be a female elf of very lithe form who turns to you and goes, "Actually, it is a woman, but I'll ignore that."
 MARISHA: Sorry, you're super covered-- literally saw no features until right now.
 MATT: "It is fine."
 MARISHA: You're very attractive though.
 (laughter)
 MATT: And she walks ahead of you and the two of you begin to make your way there. They're guiding you towards the Northward and as you step into the dark following their lead, we're going to take a break.
 (cheering)
 MARISHA: I smell bad y'all.
 TRAVIS: Do you?
 MARISHA: Don't. You were like, oh my cape smells bad and I was like RPing and I like, ooh.
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: Everybody at home, grab your ticket you got in the mail. Scratch off number three.
 (laughter)
 MATT: We'll be back here in a few minutes. For those of you who want to enter the Wyrmwood giveaway, tonight it's a special Valentine's Day promotion from our friends at Wyrmwood. They have four types of dice vaults to choose from where they translate your Valentine Day's message in Elvish.
 (gasping)
 TRAVIS: Damn that shit glows!
 MATT: So you have some golden Evish stuff there.
 LAURA: It's pretty and you can choose the wood.
 LIAM: The writing only shows up if you throw it in fire.
 (laughter)
 MATT: Don't listen to Liam. To whoever is the winner of this or any of these, they'll go ahead and get you the contact information for Wyrmwood so they can customize your phrase. If you want to be part of this giveaway over the break, make sure to use the keyword toad. T-O-A-D in the chatroom. There's also apparently an anti-Valentine's Day Drow vault they do as well. It's pretty cool. Check them out at wyrmwoodgaming.com but if you want to enter that, the codeword is toad. Only enter once please in the Twitch chat because if you do more than once, you'll be disqualified. Wait for them to notify you over the break and we'll come back with the winner when we return.
 MARISHA: They gave us an amazing matching set with the Elvis-- Elvish for our wedding. It was super sweet. Thanks Wyrmwood. Elvis from Memphis.
 MATT: (Elvis impression) "Oh that was a natural 20." We'll see you guys in a little bit.
 (cheering)
 
 Part II Edit 
 MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. Before we jump back in, we have our winner from the chat. The winner is Piamo_Feddie! If I am reading this correctly, Piamo_Feddie. Congratulations! Danoba will get your contact information, we’ll get that sent out to you. Well done, and happy Valentine’s Day. Now jumping back into the game, I would like to ask everyone but Marisha to leave the table, please.
 MARISHA: See you, guys.
 TRAVIS: Don’t die!
 MARISHA: This is so scary! So nerve wracking.
 MATT: Beauregard.
 MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
 MATT: Quietly, they walk you through the night air, through the Northward, to a familiar place: the outskirts of the Baumbauch Family Brewery. There's a slight opening on the side warehouse doors where you had previously worked when you first arrived at Trostenwald, and Archivist Zeenoth gestures for you to enter. "Please. If you don't mind, my dear."
 MARISHA: Really? Is this what got me caught, working for these fucking assholes? Ugh. I walk in.
 MATT: There is a single glowing lantern that is currently hanging from a rope that is strewn across the ceiling of the warehouse that gives a central source of light to the room. It causes the shadows to stretch out very long across the sides.
 MARISHA: What is this?
 MATT: As you walk in and turn around, the door is closed. The two figures approach. The female elf goes and takes a chair and sets it in the center beneath the lantern. "Please, have a seat."
 MARISHA: I'd prefer to stand.
 MATT: She just sits back, about 20 or so feet, and leans against one of the large stacks of crates as Zeenoth approaches you. "Now, Beauregard. You have been what the Archive would call a problematic student."
 MARISHA: (laughter)
 MATT: "I've had to pull in quite a bit of a favor--"
 MARISHA: Sorry. (laughter) Keep going. I'm listening.
 MATT: "Since I have been assigned to your tutelage, overseeing your progress and training, you've shown great promise, in many ways. You're a seeker of truth, and you have a keen sense for manipulations and falsehoods. Correct?"
 MARISHA: Thanks?
 MATT: "When the Archive took you in at the behest of your family, you agreed to undergo our discipline. Our lifestyle."
 MARISHA: No, I didn't agree to shit. You took me in because I'm assuming my father paid you a pretty nice sum of coin to make sure that you took me in. I’m assuming that coin is no longer coming to the Reserve, so, why do you care?
 MATT: "Believe it or not, not everyone does what they do in this world for coin. We see possibility in you. We, wish to prevent you from blowing out your own flame. Your tendencies clash with our teachings, your dislike for authority."
 MARISHA: Yeah, I thought you guys hated me. Thought I was doing you a favor by leaving.
 MATT: At which point, the woman from behind says, "Your dislike for authority is not a bad thing. It can keep you alive. Authority should always be questioned. Those with more power than you should be held to a higher standard."
 MARISHA: Thank you, authoritative figure who I am unaware of your name?
 MATT: At which point, Zeenoth picks up, again, says, "But the way of the Knowing Mistress has an order of learning. Your patience is essential to adhering to this path. I know it may not be stimulating at times, but we must prepare your mind if we are ever to prepare your soul."
 MARISHA: Yeah, I'd say that sorting books and punching brick walls repeatedly can definitely not be stimulating at all times.
 MATT: "Look, I just wish to--" At which point, the elven woman goes, "Enough. I've heard enough, Zeenoth. You are removed of your responsibility to oversee Beauregard." Zeenoth's eyes go wide. "This is not a student you can help. Return to Zadash." Zeenoth goes, "Expositor, I do not think that I have been given a fair shot. Please--" "I know this girl, because I see much of myself in her. You cannot reach her. Go." Zeenoth looks hurt. "I apologize that I failed you." He turns around and heads back towards the warehouse doors, which shift open, and close.
 MARISHA: The fuck was that?
 MATT: The woman now steps forward.
 MARISHA: I feel like he made me look like an asshole, feel like an asshole. Fuck, maybe I'm an asshole.
 MATT: "Maybe you're an asshole. You probably are an asshole. That's all right, because so am I. Because sometimes you need someone to be an asshole to get shit done."
 MARISHA: Being nice never did. What are we talking, stranger?
 MATT: "I am Expositor Dairon, of the Cobalt Soul."
 MARISHA: Dairon?
 MATT: D-A-I-R-O-N. "I take it you have heard of our station through whispers."
 MARISHA: Some people like to call you boogie men. I figured it was always real. In my opinion, the best way to hide in a secret organization is by having a boogie man.
 MATT: "We are the hidden strength of the library, you are not wrong. We wade in the filth of society. We weed out the corrupt. We pursue the secret evils of the world, and expose them to the light.”
 MARISHA: Wow.
 MATT: “We twist the arm of the unjust, until they spill their mysteries. We are the spies. We are the hunters. We are the watchmen to those who rule. We are not kind. We are forthright. We are truth. Do you, Beauregard, want to see the truths of the world?”
 MARISHA: Oh god, I'm sorry. I have this burn in my butt from all the smoke you just blew up my ass. It's just, oh god. Is that a magical talent?
 MATT: What's your armor class?
 MARISHA: 17.
 MATT: You suffer ten points of bludgeoning damage as, out of nowhere, her fist hits you right across the side of your face.
 MARISHA: It takes me to the ground. That takes me to the ground.
 MATT: You're unconscious?
 MARISHA: No, just takes me to the ground.
 MATT: Okay. "Are you listening now?"
 MARISHA: Do I have a choice?
 MATT: "Let me be your teacher."
 MARISHA: Oh, boy. Is that what I have to look forward to?
 MATT: "No. What do you want to do now, that that's happened?"
 MARISHA: I kind of want to fucking punch you back.
 MATT: "Then do it. What's stopping you?"
 MARISHA: Now you have my attention. And I fucking punch her in the face!
 MATT: Go for it. Roll for an attack.
 MARISHA: Just a straight unarmed, right?
 MATT: Yep.
 MARISHA: 12 total, not good.
 MATT: She dodges out of the way, and as you move past, plucks you in the back of the head with a knuckle. That hits. You take one point of bludgeoning damage. It’s a very light tap.
 MARISHA: Ow! What the fuck, my dad used to do that type of shit.
 MATT: With that, she rushes around with a rapid pace to the front of you, feints with an upper cut, and then goes to elbow you in the side of the head. That is a 16. What's your armor class?
 MARISHA: That misses. 17.
 MATT: Misses. You manage to duck out of the way of it. She goes, "Good. Good."
 MARISHA: I got to add some points here.
 MATT: Okay. She's going to go ahead and use her bonus action to go into a defensive stance. "Come on."
 MARISHA: (yells) I'm going to spend a ki point, and go into Flurry of Blows, and do a blind haymaker, a second blind haymaker, and then try and backhand with the third. Wildly, recklessly. Okay, first one. Natural 20!
 MATT: Oh, shit!
 MARISHA: Second one. Natural 20!
 MATT: Two natural 20s in a row!
 MARISHA: I don't have anyone sitting next to me to confirm this, but I swear it's a natural 20!
 MATT: No, I can see it!
 MARISHA: I'll take a picture if I have to! A natural 17.
 MATT: Roll damage on those first two!
 MARISHA: Okay. You double the dice, right?
 MATT: Yeah. Roll the dice, double it.
 MARISHA: Okay. That was a three, a two, so five, ten plus eight. 18.
 MATT: 18 points of damage. Then the third strike that hit?
 MARISHA: One, so another five points. God fucking-- Thinking of my dad, after she just went "boop," something just popping the back of my head.
 MATT: You watch as her defensive stance, she's prepared for it, and as you go to swing, she lets it down at the last second, and lets you get some hits in. Wham, wham! But much stronger than she expected. The first one clocks her across the chin. The other one hits her across the temple. The last one--
 MARISHA: Just a wild backhand.
 MATT: Just hits her in the back of the head. She stumbles for a second, then spins around. You can see a bit of blood trickling out of the corner of her mouth, and there's a little bit of a scrape of dirt on the side her head where you hit. She turns around. "Very good. You have learned some things in your time." She quickly advances on you. Hits. 18, hits. Okay. You take three points of bludgeoning damage, one per hit. Pop! Pop pop! She is basically going full in with the strike, and is just prodding you with these gentle little hits, showing control, showing that she's entirely able to overwhelm you, and she's hitting different places on your body, strategically. Because with each hit, you feel this burst of numbness in those vicinities. I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
 MARISHA: Not great. That's a natural seven, so ten total.
 MATT: Okay. After each hit, you gather yourself for a second, she stops and goes, "You are quick, and there is intelligence lying in there. You are also quite nimble at dodging blows. Do you see, with but a few simple strikes, I'm able to extract from you everything I need to know about you."
 MARISHA: What the fuck, why can't I feel my hand? What did you do?
 MATT: "You see, brute force has its place. But precision, and intent. That can take down the greatest of mountains, by poking the weakest point. Now, I know where your weak points are."
 MARISHA: You don't know shit about me, bitch. I'm going to take another attack.
 MATT: Go for it.
 MARISHA: That's a three. That's a nine.
 MATT: Nope. With each miss, or, the first miss, she's going to use a reaction to attack you. That's going to be-- She can do that. Ducks out of the way, and immediately uses a reaction to smack you in the head for one point of damage, another bludgeoning point. She's going to spend another ki point to do another reaction. She can also do that.
 MARISHA: Roll. I rolled a 15 to attack. Second attack. These are two attacks, right?
 MATT: For your second one, yeah.
 MARISHA: 15, so, 21.
 MATT: Yeah, the second one does hit. She does not get the second attack. Roll damage on that second strike.
 MARISHA: Okay. Attacking her with the first one, and then I'm just going to duck down a little and jab her right in the ribs.
 MATT: All right. What was the damage on that?
 MARISHA: Eight.
 MATT: Eight damage, nice. You crack her in the ribs, and the impact actually does catch her off guard. She ends up tumbling five feet backward across the ground, catching herself in a three-point landing.
 MARISHA: I back up. I'm going to spend another ki point to do my defensive stance. Patient defense.
 MATT: Okay. Patient defense. You go into that stance that she was in earlier, but holding it for the entirety of this. Her eyes narrow for a second. You see her looking at all the different points that she struck on you earlier, like she's reading some sort of a docket on what your physicality is. With that, she doesn't run at you, she runs around you in a circle and begins to jump off the sides of the boxes, some of the crates that are stacked up nearby. You watch them wiggle as she puts her weight up against them, leaps off--
 MARISHA: Instead of getting distracted by her, I just listen to her and look at her out of my periphery.
 MATT: Okay. Eventually, she uses her momentum to climb to the top with her feet and leap off, then come downward with the knee towards you.
 MARISHA: Right as she comes down and I'm going to use-- Oh, wait, dodge? Go first?
 MATT: You're already in your defensive stance, so her attack's at disadvantage against you. The first strike. 19, 20 to hit?
 MARISHA: Miss. It says patient defense, spend one ki point to take the dodge action as a bonus action on my turn.
 MATT: Correct, what the dodge action does is it means any attacks against you have disadvantage.
 MARISHA: Oh. Cool.
 MATT: The first one did hit. Second one does not. The third one does. Two hits still get you. Both one point of bludgeoning damage. The knee comes down, and right as it cracks into your head, she shifts to the side and glides off, and as soon as her body glides off, her back is to yours, and her spinning elbow goes and cracks you in the side of the head, but it stops short, just barely hitting you. She's toying with you at this point.
 MARISHA: You said two more points?
 MATT: Yes, two more points of bludgeoning damage. Make another constitution saving throw, please.
 MARISHA: 11. No, sorry, 12.
 MATT: This time, opposed to the pressure points being hit, there is the one smack on the side of your head.
 MARISHA: Yeah?
 MATT: This pain surges through the side of your temple, and travels through your spine, to all the points she had hit earlier, and your whole body tenses and seizes for a second. Your vision blurs, and your mouth stammers, and you're stunned for the next round. As she lands behind you, and walks around to the front of you, you're unable to, you can't move, you can't speak. “I can start you on this path. You can return to your wanderlust, your allies. Our kind learns more in the world than in a library. Agree to my instruction, to use the skills I teach you, as you return throughout your journeys. One day, you too, can become an expositor." You begin to regain control of your senses, and your speech begins to slowly return to you.
 MARISHA: Okay. I got to hand it to you, that was awesome, and I want to know how to do that. You beat me.
 MATT: "Very well. Your first lesson begins now."
 MARISHA: Okay. (groan)
 MATT: She snaps her fingers, and you watch as Zeenoth steps back in, sheepishly. "Is it over, my dear? Is it done?" "I need you to stand here for a second, Zeenoth. I need a body. Let me show you the proper pressure points." Zeenoth's eyes go wide for a second. "I don't believe--" "You owe me a favor. I found her for you, did I not?" Zeenoth sighs, sags his head, and takes his cloak off.
 MARISHA: I grab that stool, and I drag it over.
 MATT: "Now, depending on what you wish to learn, there are different places where you can pull the information from the body." Over the next few hours, working with you, and over time--
 MARISHA: Does she beat the shit out of Zeenoth?
 MATT: You both do.
 MARISHA: Sorry, Zeenoth. Sorry. God, we're such assholes.
 MATT: "Assholes that the world needs, from time to time."
 MARISHA: Yeah. The world does need an asshole. We'll work on that one together. We'll work on that. That's good, that's good.
 MATT: "I'll return to Zadash in the morning. Take what I have taught you. "When you feel it's time for more tutelage, return to me. Do not worry. I have an eye on you."
 MARISHA: What do I do until then, do I just continue--
 MATT: "Do what you must. Travel the world. Use what I've taught you. Learn about injustice. Those you don't trust, follow them. Bend them. Make them tell the truth and admit their guilt. Find where ever corruption is. Root it out and let the system do its job. If the system isn't doing its job, destroy the system."
 MARISHA: Why are you doing this? Why me?
 MATT: "Because a long time ago, I was a wayward girl with no direction, was angry, and fighting at the world. And someone did this for me."
 MARISHA: I don't really believe in systems or being a part of them, let alone a system that takes down other systems. Seems almost hypocritical.
 MATT: "Perhaps. Who knows. Maybe one day you'll find the corruption inside our own."
 MARISHA: Touche.
 MATT: "Go. Get some rest. Clean up a bit, I think you could use it."
 MARISHA: You might have broke my wrist.
 MATT: “It'll heal. Zeenoth." She slaps him awake. His unconscious body on the ground.
 MARISHA: Bye, Zeenoth! Zeenoth!
 MATT: (coughing)
 MARISHA: Zeenoth!
 MATT: "Oh dear."
 MARISHA: Bye.
 MATT: "Goodbye. I have such great pleasure in saying goodbye, and good riddance."
 MARISHA: I leave.
 MATT: You make your way back to the tavern, go back into the room, and, exhaustedly, pass out. Let's bring everyone else back in.
 MARISHA: Hi, friends. How’s it going?
 TRAVIS: Are you alive?
 LIAM: I'm sure everything went according to plan.
 TALIESIN: Quiet dignity and grace.
 MATT: As you all come to consciousness in the morning, little sore, but recovered--mostly--from the battle that wrecked you the evening before. The fresh smells of cooked meats, and the sounds of various patrons below in the inn tavern floor, rouse you to the morning. What do you wish to do?
 LIAM: Ah--
 MARISHA: Hi, guys. Sorry I snuck in last night. 
 TRAVIS: How does she look?
 MATT: She’s beat to shit.
 TRAVIS: Oh, fuck! Did you get horse kicked?
 MARISHA: Several times.
 TRAVIS: Damn. How’s the horse look?
 MARISHA: Horse is fucking dead. I ate it.
 TRAVIS: That's a bit excessive.
 MARISHA: Horse is fucking fine. Hey, Jester, do you have a bandage? Do you have a thing?
 LAURA: Oh, yes! Of course I do. I have a lot of bandages because I am the cleric.
 TRAVIS: I don't know if that bone's supposed to be sticking out of that part.
 LAURA: Yes, I'm going to open the medical kit and rummage around. Pull out some stuff. Give me your wrist! I can definitely heal this.
 TRAVIS: I bet Yasha can pop it back into place.
 MARISHA: Yeah, *crack*.
 MATT: Make a medicine check.
 TRAVIS: You just made a bow.
 TALIESIN: It was string and mime.
 MARISHA: Oh, you made it worse!
 LIAM: (blood gushing)
 LAURA: 20.
 MATT: Okay. It's actually fairly well made; it gives some nice support to it. I mean, it's more of a sprain than a break. But it helps offer some support to it. It'll heal.
 MARISHA: I've had some sprains that feel like breaks.
 MATT: Yeah, no, it hurts like a bitch, or it did last night. Or it feels a little better today, but that's definitely going to help give it some support. Good job.
 MARISHA: Thank you.
 ASHLEY: What happened to you?
 LAURA: I've been practicing.
 TRAVIS: Not you, her. What happened to *her*?
 LAURA: Oh. Sorry.
 MARISHA: Man, it was a great night. I had a great night! I haven't had a great night in a long time, you guys. That was a great night.
 TRAVIS: With the guy you--
 LAURA: You came in really late.
 TALIESIN: I'd like to see the other guy.
 MARISHA: I might have been accepted into, like, a secret society. It's kind of secret society business. It's hard to talk about.
 LAURA: Are you allowed to talk about it? Tell us about it!
 MARISHA: Okay! No, I can't. It's fine. There are these monks. I thought they hated me. It turns out they like me. Turns out they want me to become a part of their gang. But it's not really real, and they're like, "Just keep doing your thing! But you're against injustice and seek out truth and break systems!"
 LAURA: You are a hero!
 LIAM: Is this one of those dreams where nobody has their clothes on?
 TALIESIN: You know, if the monks beat you up to make them join your gang, they're not really your friends.
 MARISHA: You know, I said something like that to her. It wasn't as black and white as that.
 TALIESIN: Is that why they did that to your face there? Oh, no, they didn't. Apparently they were pretty--
 MARISHA: I wouldn't say this woman was my friend. I would say she's definitely a badass. I wouldn't say she's my friend.
 TRAVIS: This woman, was she with the fellow that you left with last night?
 MARISHA: She was. His name was Zeenoth. He's an archivist of the Cobalt Reserve. Lot of books there. Lot of books.
 TRAVIS: Cobalt Reserve. He was in the court.
 ASHLEY: Was this a test of some sort?
 MARISHA: I think so.
 LAURA: Did you pass? I mean, they made you a hero, so obviously you did.
 MARISHA: I'm not a hero. That's not what they did. It's more like a vigilante! Like what we said! Yeah!
 LAURA: This is so great. Can they let us into the secret society too?
 MARISHA: No.
 LIAM: Well, you know, this is very fascinating, but I have some errands to run. Nott, would you like to run errands with me? We are totally coming back and not leaving on our own undercover.
 TRAVIS, LAURA, and TALIESIN: Insight check.
 LIAM: Bring it on.
 MARISHA: Do you need an insight check to know that that was shady as fuck?
 TALIESIN: Fuck all.
 LAURA: 15.
 TRAVIS: 11.
 LIAM: Persuasion?
 TALIESIN: 11.
 MATT: You don't have to tell me what you're rolling!
 LIAM: I rolled a natural 20! Whatever. I'm being very honest! We're not going anywhere. But I do have errands to run. So, we're going to leave soon. Have some breakfast. I grab some bacon from Ford/Fjord’s plate, and grab Nott and head out the door.
 TALIESIN: Meet us at the circus. 
 LAURA: I'm going to draw in my sketchbook a drawing of the devil toad head rolling along the ground like a bowling ball.
 SAM and TALIESIN: She really did.
 LAURA: Well, kind of. I put the little bowling ball things on there. And he's going to run into all of us, in chains, being knocked down like pins.
 MATT: Okay. Roll a dexterity check. Why not?
 LAURA: Eight-- No, 15.
 MATT: It's very well done. There's, like, hatch mark shading.
 LAURA: Well, I did get really good training, so it's good that I know how to do shading.
 MATT: All right, what are you guys doing? The rest of you, while they rush off to go about their errands.
 TRAVIS: Apparently eating less of my bacon, motherfucker.
 TALIESIN: I'm going to pack up and head back to the circus. Start getting things together.
 ASHLEY: Yeah. I think I'll join you.
 MATT: Molly and Yasha are heading back to the carnival grounds.
 LAURA: I want to go try to buy a map.
 MARISHA: That's a good idea.
 LAURA: Yeah!
 ASHLEY: Oh, I did actually want to see that map.
 TALIESIN: I'll meet you there. Actually, you know what? I want to see you see that map.
 ASHLEY: I think that's a great idea. Seeing me see a map is something pretty special.
 TALIESIN: It's gorgeous. It's fabulous.
 MATT: You guys, where are you heading off to?
 LIAM: I have two places to go. The first, we're going to the Burnished Bibelots. The second is a surprise. But I know that I whisked you away in a hurry the other day and you weren't done browsing.
 SAM: That sounds lovely and I would like to browse there again, but, honestly, Caleb, I am very worried about you. You have passed out twice in the last few days, and unless we get you a healing potion, there is no promise that you will still be alive tomorrow. I think we should go to Natural Remedies. You distract the owner while I go in the back and I steal a healing potion. It's the only way to guarantee your safety.
 LIAM: Maybe that's the third place that we go. I will point out your point, which was that these crazy bastards are very distracting and strange, yeah?
 SAM: Yes!
 LIAM: So they could be my healing potion, you know? We'll talk about it. Third place. So, drag her off to the Burnished Bibelots. Boom, in the door.
 MATT: You head inside. It looks as chaotic as you left it. You see what looks to be a small bowl of heated porridge that's gathered on the counter, and cross-legged on top is the fantastic gnomish purveyor of the interior, Oglen. "Hello?"
 LIAM: Good day to you, sir!
 MATT: "Good day to you as well."
 LIAM: I give Nott a little shove over towards the shelves and walk up to him, right up to the counter. What are you eating there? That looks good.
 MATT: "Breakfast."
 LIAM: All right, yeah. That's what that is. You know, I wanted to thank you for the book. I don't know if you read it yourself, but I read it cover to cover quickly. It was fascinating and very useful. (I hope you're doing stuff over there.)
 MATT: "All sales are final!"
 LIAM: Well, here's the thing. I have read this book and loved it, and if you would like to purchase it for the low, low price of one gold, you can sell it again. You sold it to me for three. You have it back for one. You can turn a profit.
 MATT: Make a persuasion check.
 LIAM: Natural 20.
 MATT: You watch as some of the porridge is spilling out the side of his mouth, and he rubs it off. "All right." And he pulls a gold coin out of his pouch.
 LIAM: That is a good decision, and it was a good book. I am grateful for the knowledge you have imparted upon me.
 MATT: "Might I have the book?"
 LIAM: Oh, of course! It's right here on the table. Sorry, grandfather.
 MATT: "All sales are final."
 LIAM: Right. You will not sell that back to me, for sure.
 MATT: "Do you want it? I can sell it to you for three gold."
 LIAM: That's a good price. Nott, how are you doing?
 SAM: (chewing) Bacon's really good!
 LIAM: All done for the day?
 SAM: I'm looking around for something to swipe.
 MATT: Make an investigation check. You guys keep just shaking down this poor gnome guy.
 SAM: Ten.
 MATT: Looking around, I mean, a lot of this is knick-knacks and inane garbage, and things that just aren't quite worth what you'd be looking for. You do find one art piece that looks like it's a pretty good art piece with a decent frame, might be worth a little bit, but that's the best you can find. Everything else here looks like it's the dingy side of the Salvation Army.
 SAM: Anything small? Ooh! Can I find my old flask that I left here?
 MATT: Yes, I'll let you do that. It has not moved from where you placed it.
 SAM: I'm going to steal back my old flask.
 MATT: Make a sleight of hand check, please.
 LIAM: What is that little dancer toy? Between the three red mushrooms on the shelf behind you, is that a music box there?
 MATT: "It is a music box." He takes it and cranks it.
 SAM: 24.
 MATT: "It was a music box."
 LIAM: It's lost the magic.
 MATT: "I can fix it."
 LIAM: How long would that take?
 MATT: He breaks it open, looks inside. "Three days."
 LIAM: Okay. Well, I'll come back and see your work in three days. Work on that and your breakfast. Hey Nott, are you ready?
 SAM: Mm-hmm!
 LIAM: All right. Good day to you. Happy sales.
 MATT: "Happy sales, as well."
 LIAM: Sure. Out the door.
 SAM: I rolled a 24.
 MATT: Yeah, he did not notice at all.
 LIAM: I'm going to head in the direction, dragging my goblin friend with me, to that fancy bathhouse that was described to me last night at the Nestled Nook.
 MATT: You guys make your way southward. Go ahead and make a general charisma check.
 LIAM: Charisma check? Well, something I wanted to do before we got there, was going to do it maybe in an alley, but you tell me, is I would like to cast Disguise Self on myself. Presumably gone into an alleyway so no one sees me doing this in the middle of the road. I take the form of a man in very fancy green robes, beautiful blond hair, very handsome man, with a vomit stain down the front of my clothes.
 MATT: Okay. Specific and easily done.
 LIAM: I drag my little friend along with me. You are going to like this, this is something very special.
 SAM: I'm excited.
 LIAM: Oh, charisma check. Straight charisma?
 MATT: Straight charisma. Add your modifier.
 LIAM: Yeah, it's 11.
 MATT: 11, okay. With your Disguise Self form, it's easy enough for you to ask a few questions, and eventually you are given directions to what is called the Warm Dew Bathhouse. Warm Dew.
 LAURA: Warm Doo, D-O-O.
 MATT: D-E-W.
 LIAM: Dew, dew. There's a liquid u in that.
 TRAVIS: Warm doo. Thank you.
 MATT: It'll be one before you bathe there and the other when you leave.
 (laughter)
 LIAM: All right, let's enter this establishment.
 MATT: For as far south as this is, it's pretty decent compared to the other areas. Most of the Hillsward-- you get the sense that most of the rural farming community that fills out most of Trostenwald, a lot of the money that gets made goes directly to the central portion of this ward, where this bathhouse is. It's small, but it's really well put together. As you walk inside, you can see there marble busts set on the side of the entrance way, each side. You can see nice tapestries that are pulled back over the windows, and as both of you walk in, you see this young man, maybe his mid-twenties or so. Human, but he looks very thin and sickly, like he had a rough upbringing, and his general constitution has suffered for it. He has a warm smile, and he's wearing these long white robes with what looks to be a yellowish scarf that's wrapped around as he approaches. "Hello and good morning. Can I help you?"
 LIAM: Yes, one moment. (quietly) Stay close to me and let me do the talking. (louder) Hello, please, don't focus-- my daughter is shy.
 MATT: "I'm very sorry."
 LIAM: I’ve had a terrible day. Some disgusting derelict has vomited all over me, I smell like filth, and I would like to spend a couple of hours in your finest bath. Maybe not your finest. A good bath, for a couple of hours. My daughter and I. I will need adjoining baths, if you have that. For modesty's sake, my daughter and I.
 MATT: "That can be done. Of course." Make a persuasion check.
 LIAM: (humming) There's a 12.
 MATT: "For two hours, that will run-- for two baths adjoining, we'll put it at eight silver pieces."
 LIAM: That's fine. I definitely have that. I take out the eight silver, I slap it down.
 MATT: "Wonderful. We'll show you to your bathroom."
 LIAM: Okay. Come along, dear.
 SAM: Yes, Vater.
 MATT: You guys are escorted to what-- It's really off-putting for the two of you. Not only is the smell clean inside here, but there's the scent of lavender in the hallway, and you hear soft music in the distance. As you walk past, you do see that there is a resident violinist that plays, and you guys are led to these two--
 SAM: This is really nice!
 LIAM: Yes, it is.
 SAM: They got a violinist over there! I'm sorry, zey got a violinist over zere, Vater.
 LIAM: That's meine Liebchen. I'm hoping for a hot bath for the both of us. It has been a long bit of travel.
 MATT: "Right this way." Leads you into the chambers. There is a glass, fogged window, so the sunlight comes through, but no one can see through. There are some linens set out, a towel, and two basins that are freshly filled with steaming water. You are left into the chamber.
 LIAM: Are they separate, though?
 MATT: They're separated by a small wall that's eye length, but you can still talk to each other over it.
 LIAM: Excellent. This is called a bath.
 SAM: I've heard of them.
 LIAM: A hot bath. We have been pretty dinged up for the past several months, and we might not get back into something like this for a while, so I want you to enjoy it. Go over to your side, and I will be here. Nott, I'm going to do a bit of reading.
 SAM: While you bathe?
 LIAM: Yes.
 SAM: You'll still be the same Caleb when you're done, right?
 LIAM: Yes, I will be the same Caleb.
 SAM: I've gotten used to you, and now you're going to change a bit.
 LIAM: Trust me, I will not.
 SAM: All right.
 LIAM: Once she is clear of the wall, I'm going to start actually disrobing, although I guess the illusion stays.
 MATT: The illusion stays. Strangely, clothes start apparating out of you. (slurping)
 MARISHA: It's like a bad video game glitch. Bad texture glitch.
 LIAM: Nott, I'm probably going to go quiet for a little while.
 SAM: No problem. I'll just be over here, you know, bathing.
 LIAM: Enjoy it. I find the second book and examine it. Am I able to read this?
 MATT: You are, actually. There is one incomplete arcane inscription in there. Unfortunately, it's been too burned, beyond recognition. You can see this was a spellbook. Mostly destroyed, but there are two complete spells in there that, if you wish to, you could transcribe over into your book. Those would be Arcane Lock and Unseen Servant.
 ALL: Ooh!
 LIAM: All my actual clothes are off. I'm going to take the book and set it on the edge of the basin.
 MATT: Because you paid for it, there is a hinged, small desk piece where food can be eaten, or drinks could be served while people are taking a bath.
 LIAM: I set it down. I sit with just my legs in the bath for a moment, and I look at the book.
 SAM: I'm going to find the pitcher of cucumber water, dump it on the floor, and eat all the cucumbers.
 (laughter)
 MATT: As you hear over the wall (gobbling).
 SAM: Look around for anything in the room that can be stolen?
 MATT: Plenty of things, actually. No one's watching. There's a vase that's really nice. The doorknob itself is a brass, gold-like material.
 SAM: I'll start working on that.
 MATT: Using your thieves’ tools, you can get that free, if you want.
 SAM: After a while, I put a toe into the water, feel it, and I'm like: Nah. I'll use my empty flask and fill it up with water.
 MATT: Okay. You get a water flask.
 SAM: Then work on the doorknob.
 MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a thieves' tools check, adding your dexterity.
 SAM: 12.
 MATT: Add the dexterity and your proficiency.
 SAM: Oh. 14.
 MATT: There you go. With very little sound the doorknob comes off, and you have now a solid brass doorknob. There is the vase.
 SAM: Is it a big vase?
 MATT: It's like that big. It's more of a decorative flower holder over by the window.
 SAM: Sure. I'll try to get that too.
 MATT: Easy. You get it. There's nobody watching you!
 SAM: I'll also save the flowers in a separate pouch.
 MATT: Okay. There you go.
 SAM: Any towels. Ooh, you know what?
 MATT: Yeah, the linens can be taken.
 SAM: I'm going to take one towel and tear it into shreds, and use it to replace any of my bandages that have worn or fallen off.
 MATT: Easy enough. There's some nice clean bandages. Good.
 SAM: I'm good.
 LIAM: On my side, while all of that is happening, two things. One is that when I finally get into the tub I dip my whole body almost entirely in, but not my head or hair. Letting the bruises soak in the hot water, which feels wonderful. The second thing is, while flipping the pages of this book, very still, I can hear all of this, and it is extremely endearing, but I go completely still. Completely quiet. And read in peace.
 MATT: While you guys are taking a bath, the rest of you are going off on a shopping trip. Except for you, you're going to--
 TALIESIN: No, I'm going map hunting.
 MATT: That's right. You're going. Who's all going together?
 LAURA: All of us.
 MATT: Where are you going?
 LAURA: Okay, I'm going to ask Yorda if there's a map maker in town.
 TALIESIN: Or if she can draw us a map of how to get there.
 MATT: "There's not much of a specific cartographer in place. Most of the cartography guilds are up north in either Zadash or Rexxentrum. There might be one in Alfield? We're a bit small over here. You could ask the general store, or you could maybe go to the stockade. They have maps there but they use those. You might be able to pay enough for them."
 LAURA: I don't want to go back to the stockade.
 MATT: "Then maybe check the general store or any of the strange book places might have something old and lying in the back."
 LAURA: Ooh, what strange book places?
 MATT: "Well, let's see. There's the Hillsbrook Parchment and Binding. There's the Burnished Bibelots, that I think one of your friends has already been to. Those are the two strange book places. I'm not much of a reader myself, so I couldn't tell you."
 LAURA: Can you draw me a map of how to get to those places?
 MARISHA: We've already been to the general store.
 LAURA: Yes, you're right. I guess we can try that place.
 MARISHA: You can still make her draw a map. I don't want to rain on your parade. I'm sorry.
 TRAVIS: You just shit all over her.
 MARISHA: I totally did.
 MATT: She gives you directions.
 LAURA: Let's go on a trip!
 MATT: Where are you guys going first?
 MARISHA: (singing) General store!
 LAURA: We've been there before.
 MARISHA: (singing) I want to buy another health pack!
 SAM: Health pack?
 MARISHA: I meant a healer's kit.
 LAURA: The general store doesn't like us very much. Oh wait. That healer's kit, is that the one you bought when we were together?
 MARISHA: Yeah.
 LAURA: You spent way too much money on it because I changed the tag?
 MARISHA: Yeah. That one.
 LAURA: That was great. Now I have it. Cool.
 MARISHA: You won twice.
 MATT: Everything's coming up Jester.
 LAURA: All right, let's go back there. They don't like me, but let's go back there.
 MARISHA: I can just pop in if you want to wait outside.
 LAURA: They don't like you either.
 MARISHA, Yeah, but they like money. Let's go.
 MATT: All right, so you guys make your way to Lochward General in the Lochward District. As you enter, the older woman, Harper Mince, is there in the general store. It's the large, almost wooden barn exterior. The front door opens two ways, and the inside is wall-to-wall lined with tools for farming and farming equipment for building. There's lumber. There's all sorts of iron nails. It's by all accounts a rural general store.
 MATT: You see on far end is Harper, the older woman there, standing and looking out at the rest of you. "Hi, can I help you? What are you looking for?"
 LAURA: We are looking for pickles, did you get any yet?
 MATT: "No, we don't sell pickles here, sorry."
 LAURA: Most general stores have pickles, this is the only thing.
 MARISHA: You're not wrong, generally, yeah.
 MATT: "We can order some pickles, if you like."
 LAURA: Yeah, you probably should. I think you would do well if you sold pickles. Do you have maps for sale of the area?
 MATT: "The area? Let me check. I'll be right back."
 LAURA: Does she leave the room?
 MATT: Yeah, she does. She leaves the room.
 TRAVIS: Don't-- put your hands in your pockets.
 LAURA: Don't put my hands in my pockets, got it! I start running around and just moving everything on the shelves again the same way as before.
 MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.
 SAM: You're just moving things?
 LAURA: Yeah, just like moving--
 TRAVIS: Please be Laura when she was five and break shit.
 LAURA: Oh yes! 18 plus five.
 TALIESIN: This is beautiful.
 MATT: With nary a squeak you completely rearrange in a period of about two and a half minutes most of the price cards that are dangling from a number of the tools, their placement. You guys all sit back and watch as this glorious display-- you can almost hear the William Tell Overture begin to play in the back of your head as she rummages back and forth throughout the interior of the chamber, turning things around and sticking them in the ground. It has been completely rearranged.
 LIAM: Why is this crowbar seven gold?
 MATT: Eventually you hear some rummaging from the back room and some footsteps coming nearby and you quickly stop and return to your original point there and Harper Mince returns from the back room. She has a few papers in her arms. She goes, "I'm sorry, we don't have any maps of the local area for detail. I have a map of the Dwendalian Empire as a whole, I hope that's enough."
 LAURA: I mean, that could work, I suppose. It's not what we *need*, but if that's what you have that's what we can buy from you.
 MATT: "All right, let me look at the date here. This will run about seven silver."
 LAURA: Okay, that sounds like a good price, yeah.
 MARISHA: Can I also get another healer's kit? If you have one.
 MATT: "Right, yes, let me go ahead and get that for you here." The healer's kit. Looking up the pricing in the equipment section.That is five gold pieces for the healer's kit.
 (groaning)
 MARISHA: Five gold.
 MATT: All right, mark it off. You get yourself a secondary healer's kit.
 MARISHA: Well, one healer's kit. She's got the other one.
 MATT: You hand over the seven silver?
 LAURA: Yes, I do.
 MATT: She takes it and put the ribbon back on it. *Finally* get to give that to you guys.
 LIAM: Shut the front door!
 LAURA: I have a pretty ribbon out of it.
 TALIESIN: We're going to Goonies this really quickly here. Ready?
 LAURA: What the fuck?!
 SAM: That's beautiful! Who made this? Did you make this?
 MATT: I designed the layout, but the map is made by a wonderful woman named Deven Rue, who does incredible handcrafted maps.
 SAM: You got to get a camera on this shit.
 TRAVIS: Hold it up!
 MARISHA: Put it in the middle.
 TALIESIN: Take a look, it's amazing!
 TRAVIS: Oh my god!
 MARISHA: Wait, where are we?
 MATT: You guys are in Trostenwald, right there. This is north, this is south.
 SAM: Angle it to that camera.
 LAURA: What camera?
 MATT: This is the Dwendalian Empire. This is not all of Wildemount, this is just a portion. Deven did an incredible job with this. You should follow her on Patreon or Twitter, she does amazing work. She does incredible work.
 LAURA: Oh my god, you guys, let's go all of these places.
 ASHLEY: Maybe not *all* of them.
 LAURA: Okay, we are definitely going to visit this place called Hupperdook.
 SAM: I think I had one of those this morning.
 LAURA: Then we'll make our way up to Nogvuror. Oh man, this is awesome. Hey look, look over here! This is where I live!
 SAM: There be dragons there.
 TALIESIN: You live in a serpent?
 LAURA: Uh-huh.
 MATT: By the way, Deven, who did the map, it is her birthday today.
 MARISHA: Happy birthday, Deven!
 LAURA: Damn, this is amazing! Okay, I'll leave it up here.
 TALIESIN: If you pull out a real medi-kit now I'm going to be really excited. 50 bandages come flying in...
 ASHLEY: That is so beautiful.
 MATT: She did an incredible job. The exchange is done, you have your map. Anything else you guys want to handle?
 TALIESIN: Medi-kit?
 MARISHA: I got it.
 LAURA: Can I just look around and see if there's anything interesting to buy in here, like--
 MATT: There's plenty of tools. There are various packs of supplies.
 LAURA: I guess if I bought the painter's kit then it just stays and I don't run out of that.
 MATT: Over time you would run out of it.
 LAURA: But I'm good on paint?
 MATT: Good for a while.
 TRAVIS: Can I actually approach the storekeep and say: do you know of any stores that have arcane items, things with magical properties, healing potions?
 MATT: "I'm sorry, we're a bit out of the center of the country for arcane items. You'd want to go further north for that."
 TRAVIS: Further north? I appreciate your time, thank you.
 MATT: "Of course."
 MARISHA: This town blows.
 TRAVIS: She's right fucking there.
 MARISHA: I don't care.
 TRAVIS: Shall we depart?
 LAURA: Sure. Thank you so much for this beautiful map. You did a really good job drawing it.
 MATT: Take your map.
 ASHLEY: I also really like what you've done with the place.
 MATT: "Thank you very much--"
 MARISHA: Let's go, bye! Thank you!
 MATT: As you guys all exit, she begins to come around the counter.
 LAURA: Wherever we go, I'm going to bury my head in the map and walk behind everybody like a total tourist.
 TALIESIN: Well, that's the question: are we going to be able to grab a cart or two from the circus?
 MATT: You can probably get a cart.
 TALIESIN: Like one of the little vardos? Can we snag a vardo?
 MATT: Technically it's *a* vardo and the three of them took it. There's a vardo and then there's some carts. You weren't rolling with a pretty heavy-- honestly, most of the room in the carts was either for carrying you guys, whatever small bags you had with you, and the poles you would assemble to make the tent. Are you guys done with your business? Anything else you want to do while you're out and about?
 TRAVIS: That's it for me.
 LAURA: There's nowhere we can buy healing potions in this city?
 MATT: There's Natural Remedies, which you've passed before, but not entered. It's an herbal healers establishment.
 LAURA: Let's try that.
 TALIESIN: I'm very wary of this, but fine.
 TRAVIS: It's going to smell like “Sephoria,” I know it.
 LAURA: Sephora.
 TRAVIS: That's the fancy version.
 MATT: Now you guys had left earlier, so as you guys head toward Natural Remedies, you guys finish your bath.
 LIAM: I pack up. I assume we’re staying for an hour, and I have to cast Disguise Self again to keep the illusion going. I'm done, you look--
 SAM: I splashed some water on my face.
 LIAM: --refreshed.
 SAM: Oh, it was such a good bath. I'm ready to go now, I feel refreshed.
 LIAM: Did you like it, though?
 SAM: It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
 LIAM: I wanted to repay you for all you've done for me for the past couple of days.
 SAM: Consider it paid! You look the same. Does he look the same?
 MATT: Yeah.
 LIAM: The brief moment that I was in my own guise nothing changed up here, so I look exactly the way I did this morning.
 LAURA: What's the purpose of that?
 LIAM: Who said that? You wanted to do something, right?
 SAM: I wanted to go to Herbal Remedies and see if we could get you a healing potion.
 LIAM: Let's do that then. You lead the way. Well wait, you lead the way outside. Let's keep our little schtick going here and then off we go.
 MATT: All right. As you guys exit--
 SAM: Auf Wiedersehen!
 MATT: I trust you enjoyed your time in the bath, thank you.
 LIAM: Yes, but we have to go. Sorry, I'm late for a very important appointment. I drag Nott right out of here because I saw no doorknob on the door.
 MATT: Yeah, amongst other things. You guys make your way out and beeline it towards the Lochward to where you would find Natural Remedies. The rest of you guys as approach the exterior. Amongst the rest of the buildings in the central city, Natural Remedies is, for lack of a better term, humble. It's a small shack, but as soon as you approach it has very strong, pungent smells of funguses.
 TRAVIS: Instant headache.
 MATT: Yep. On the outside you can see, right where the doorway is open there are strings of herbs that are tied up and left to dry out. On the inside, you can already see that there are shelves of various flora and fauna that are being cultivated for various remedies and means of selling to anyone who wants to come by and procure, herbal medicines. Let's see who’s handling this one, because you guys have not been here yet. As you enter the main chamber--
 LIAM: Sorry, I will say that on the where there that I dropped the disguise, somewhere.
 MATT: Okay, easily enough, so you guys haven't arrived yet. You guys have arrived. The interior it's a very musty smell on the inside, too. There's a lot of fungus being grown on the inside here, and you can see that elements of it may have expanded into the corner of the actual room and it's not necessarily the nicest space to be wandering in. It seems natural. Across the way, you see a gentleman of relatively tanned skin, with darker hair that's ratty and clustered. He's in his late twenties or so, looks to be upon closer inspection partial elven blood, partial human blood, and he's in the process of carefully carving a large stalk of what looks like a fungus off of a small put that he pulled off one of the shelves. As you enter, he doesn't even make eye contact he goes, "Hello, please, just wait a moment. There we are. Hi, can I help you?
 LAURA: Hi, my friends keep dying. Do you have any health potions?
 MATT: "We have a handful, that is correct. How many are you looking to purchase?"
 LAURA: How many do you have?
 MATT: "Four."
 LAURA: Ooh. That will last us probably, like, a day.
 MATT: "What do you do for a living?"
 LAURA: We're superheroes.
 TALIESIN: Sword jugglers.
 MATT: "Why would-- Fine, who am I to ask?"
 MARISHA: Look at this bruise.
 MATT: "I cut fungus for a living."
 MARISHA: Look, it's in the shape of a dick.
 MATT: "I'm not going to ask. Four? Did you want them?”
 LAURA: Sure, yes. How much for four healing potions?
 MATT: "For four healing potions," and he pulls them out and plops them on the table, "240 gold pieces."
 TALIESIN: Level two.
 LAURA: Okay, hold on. I open up my pack and I pour out all my money. I start counting it.
 ASHLEY: Do you have a deal, you know, if we got all of them. That seems pretty high. Right? That seems pretty high for a healing potion.
 MATT: Make a persuasion check with disadvantage. Yasha: the wheeler and dealer.
 ASHLEY: Three.
 MATT: "No, actually, I think it's rather standard in these parts. But I can put them back."
 TALIESIN: Healing potions aside, you are doing something really interesting and exciting here. You're not a healing potion dealer. What are you doing here? Like this is fascinating.
 MATT: "Oh, I create all sorts of means of tending to wounds and loss of stamina. To be honest, a lot of people come around here for performance-enhancing drugs."
 TALIESIN: I don't know, I feel like you can excite me. I feel like there's something that you have to show that's really exciting. I'm not entirely sure it's all about stamina, I think you've got something-- you did that on purpose. Talk to me like I'm a child, show me something I've never seen before.
 MATT: Make a persuasion check.
 TALIESIN: Not with advantage, because I don't have it, but I was so excited.
 MATT: Nope.
 TALIESIN: Persuasion check. 19. I'm fishing for drugs, I'm not going to lie. I've been on the road a long time, I don't remember how to do this.
 MATT: He leans in close to you, "Mind closing the door?"
 TALIESIN: I skip over to the door and gingerly close it.
 MATT: "Keep curious company, that's true."
 TALIESIN: Yes, I do. And we're leaving town, today.
 MATT: "Those are magical words for a man of my business. Are you a fan of skein?"
 TALIESIN: I don't actually know what that is.
 MATT: "Well," and he goes back into the back chamber, comes back with a small satchel. There's a finely, dried, dusted material on the inside, it has a grayish-blue color to it. He goes, "This is a dried, and ground fungus called skein. It's called skein because when you eat it you can see the weave of time."
 MARISHA: Is that what skein means?
 MATT: "It's a woven skein, it's a joke on fate-- never mind."
 TALIESIN: I thought it was very clever.
 MATT: "Thank you very much. It's effective, it's popular on the outskirts where it's not so heavily controlled and carries a huge jail-time if caught. How much are you looking to purchase?"
 TALIESIN: I've got to be honest I'm not made of money, but I'm always curious for a new experience.
 MARISHA: Can I do an insight check on this guy?
 MATT: Sure, go for it.
 MARISHA: See if he's trying to scam us.
 MATT: Go for it.
 MARISHA: Can I use my criminal background?
 MATT: Sure.
 LIAM: All right, Marisha said that, not Beauregard.
 MARISHA: To know if he's actually giving what he's giving?
 MATT: You know what? Make your insight check.
 MARISHA: Just straight insight.
 MATT: Straight insight. 
 MARISHA: It's not as good as I would've hoped. 18.
 MATT: Not as good as I hoped: 18.
 LIAM: That's a slam dunk at level two.
 MATT: Seems on the level, seems excited that somebody's asking about it. You get that sense that maybe he makes a lot of this either for himself or in hopes that somebody asks about it and is seemingly excited that someone in the bumfuck town, in his opinion, would even have interest. You have once encountered this substance before, and it does seem legit.
 MARISHA: Okay.
 ASHLEY: How do we know that's good quality, though? Can I give it a sample?
 TALIESIN: Well this might be complicated, I think that just-- What would--
 TRAVIS: How about a few experiences?
 TALIESIN: A few experiences worth. What would that run me?
 MATT: Hey guys, we're dealing DandD drugs.
 TALIESIN: I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for dragging the entire audience into this. Hopefully, your children are already asleep, I do apologize.
 SAM: DandD Beyond, everybody. Our sponsor for the evening.
 TALIESIN: Thank you for really bringing that to earth for me. You started this.
 MATT: "I'll put you in at a gold an experience, how about that?"
 TALIESIN: All right. Yeah, put me in for one. I'll try anything once.
 MATT: He takes a small little batch of this dried, powdered fungus, and puts it into a small glass vial, corks it, and hands it over.
 ASHLEY: Well, you might as well make another one. I'm not going to let my friend experience it alone.
 TALIESIN: What's it called? Skein?
 MATT: Skein. S-K-E-I-N. I believe that's how it's spelled.
 LAURA: Yasha, you should take it with them. Right now. It'll be fun.
 TALIESIN: No, this is not how this works. This is not how this works. We bank our moments for those moments when life is disappointing.
 TRAVIS: I know a unique substance when I see it, I'll take one as well.
 TALIESIN: Oh my god.
 MARISHA: One for me too.
 TALIESIN: This can come in handy in all sorts of ways.
 MATT: Goddamn it, guys.
 TALIESIN: The fact that you had this ready means that there is no shame here. You were ready for this.
 MATT: You're right, I am not making any of this up on the spot at all.
 TALIESIN: I know I can tell!
 LIAM: This guy went from the Simpson's Safeway clerk to the shadiest motherfucker in a snap of time, because of your question.
 TALIESIN: A big, purple, pierced demon walked into the room and was like, hello.
 LIAM: Yes, can I help you, good sir? Yes, I can help you.
 TRAVIS: I'll tell you what, because you are such a purveyor of such interesting items, I will take one of those health potions, but for 50 gold. That's the running price I've seen in neighboring towns, and I don't mean to be swindled.
 MARISHA: I assume you'd want to go ahead and give it to us for that so that we keep this a secret.
 MATT: Make a persuasion check, with advantage.
 TRAVIS: 21.
 MATT: "50 gold," and he pulls his hair back a bit, "Seems fair." Takes a potion and hands it over. He scoops a little vial and says, "And for fun." He throws it over.
 LIAM: You fucking badass.
 SAM: Cut to an hour later, and someone's jamming an adrenaline needle.
 MATT: TPK by misuse?
 TALIESIN: Somewhere around level eight, this is going to be hilarious. Somewhere around level eight someone's going to go shopping and the rest of us are going to be like: this is now, this is happening now.
 MATT: This has become the longest afterschool special I think we've ever experienced.
 TALIESIN: Years in the making.
 MATT: He immediately gets nervous at her mention of--
 TALIESIN: She's fine, she's just awful, you're a gentleman, I hope to see you again. I'm looking forward to this.
 MATT: "I'll be here."
 TALIESIN: Of course, we never met you, you never met us.
 MATT: "Of course not. I don't know who you are."
 TALIESIN: I am already out the door, with a flourish.
 MATT: At which point, you run outside just as Caleb and Nott are approaching.
 MARISHA: Before I go out I say, nice to meet you, mister--?
 MATT: "Davies."
 TRAVIS: The decision was still happening by the time you got to the last letter.
 MARISHA: I go: Okay, Davies.
 LAURA: I guess I'll scoop all my money back into my pouch, and leave.
 MARISHA: Do you want anything?
 LAURA: No.
 MATT: You bump into Caleb and Nott on the way out.
 LIAM: What's the matter, do you have a cold?
 LAURA: You don't smell bad, what did you do?
 MATT: Actually, ironically, his clothes do still smell pretty bad, and he still looks awful.
 LAURA: You don't smell as bad.
 MATT: That's true, on a gradient scale he does smell a little better.
 LIAM: I will take that as a compliment, thank you. What are you guys doing here, are you shopping? What do they have in there?
 LAURA: They bought drugs.
 TRAVIS: That is an over-exaggeration.
 TALIESIN: That is an extreme over-exaggeration. We got a health potion.
 SAM: All of you?
 MARISHA: Well, it was kind of a ploy to get a cheaper health potion.
 TALIESIN: It worked.
 MARISHA: And we got drugs on top of it. It was a win-win am I right?
 LAURA: If you guys go in there and you buy a health potion, don't spend as much as he says because apparently, he was lying.
 LIAM: How much do they run for?
 TRAVIS: Health potions were quoted at 70, but he was kind enough to understand that 50 was enough.
 LIAM: 70?
 TRAVIS: Gold pieces.
 SAM: North we go.
 TALIESIN: North, to the horses.
 LIAM: We have a plan for the day.
 LAURA: Yes, and I show them the map that we just got. We're heading that way. Can I take the ribbon that was wrapped around the map and tie it around one of my horns?
 MATT: Easily enough.
 MARISHA: That's cute.
 LAURA: Thank you.
 SAM: We could rob the store.
 LIAM: Do you have a strategy for that?
 SAM: I mean, we could use one of our pre-planned strategies.
 LIAM: Which one would that be, because I was thinking about it on the walk here and I can't think which one applies.
 TALIESIN: I was going to say, robbing shady people is usually a bad idea.
 MARISHA: Do we hear them doing these plans? Do we hear you guys making this plan?
 LIAM: No, I wouldn't be saying this out loud if you're close.
 SAM: We could just the simplest: the prince and the pauper.
 LIAM: Here's the thing, I have died almost twice in two days. We have our friends and I think that's a good way to start.
 SAM: All right.
 LIAM: I mean, you know, we almost all got pinched yesterday.
 SAM: You're right, we should leave town with our wits about us, and full of health. Let's just go while we're ahead. Besides, I got plenty of stuff today.
 LIAM: You and me?
 SAM: Yeah, let's go.
 LIAM: All right. Okay, where are we going first?
 LAURA: We're heading north to--
 LIAM: Is it this big?
 MATT: That's the size of the map.
 LAURA: I mean, we can stop through Alfield first and see if there's anything cool there, or-- what city was it that the academy was in?
 MARISHA: "Solstrice?"
 MATT and TRAVIS: Soltrice.
 MARISHA: Is that the name of the town?
 TALIESIN: No I don't think it's the name of the town.
 LAURA: I mean the ultimate goal, you guys, is to get to Hupperdook, but-
 TALIESIN: What about Yogurt?
 LAURA: That's an after-thought.
 TALIESIN: It usually is.
 LIAM: How far off does Hupperdook look?
 LAURA: Well we have to pass through Felderwin, and the Felderwin Village first.
 SAM: Let's skip that one, please
 LAURA: Oh, is that the one you don't like? Okay, then we'll go up through Alfield, and then Zadash, and then we'll cut across and go to Hupperdook.
 MARISHA: Is that where your clan is from?
 SAM: They roam about.
 ASHLEY: You don't want to go to Zadash, is that right?
 MARISHA: Nah, it's cool. We can go back.
 TRAVIS: It's cool now?
 MARISHA: Yeah, I mean there's a few places that I didn't get to see in my sight-seeing roundabout, didn't get to hit everything. Now that I've slept on it, I've had a change of heart. It's a nice town.
 LAURA: How long of a travel would it be to get to Zadash from where we are now?
 MATT: Following the road is longer, but it's safest. That'll probably be close to 200 miles to Zadash.
 SAM: Jesus. We're on foot.
 TALIESIN: No, we've got a cart.
 SAM: A cart.
 MATT: You do have a cart. A single cart.
 LAURA: A horse? Let's go back to the inn and ask Yorda if she knows if Alfield is a big city.
 LIAM: Do I have any knowledge of Alfield?
 TALIESIN: I came though Alfield, didn't I?
 MATT: No, you guys traveled around. You came from Felderwin, and curved around the Ustaloch. 
 TALIESIN: That's right.
 MATT: Alfield is actually slightly smaller than Trostenwald, it's a stop on the way to Zadash. Zadash is the second-largest city in the kingdom.
 MARISHA: What do I know about Zadash that I could tell them? Can I tell them anything?
 MATT: It was the last conquered bastion of the previous government before the empire entirely took the valley.
 MARISHA: That's right. Zadash is on the edge of the empire too, right?
 MATT: It was, but now it's more central. It expanded past and took over Trostenwald, Alfield, it expanded all the way into the valley.
 LIAM: Will you share your map with me for just for one minute?
 LAURA: Of course.
 SAM: This is a good trick he does. He can look at it once and it will stay with him forever.
 LAURA: Really?
 SAM: Yes, it's amazing, you can quiz on it later. While he's memorizing it, Yasha, is that your name again?
 ASHLEY: Yasha.
 SAM; It's like Ash, with an -ay.
 ASHLEY: Not really, but close enough.
 SAM: I got you these flowers.
 ASHLEY: Oh.
 SAM: Thought that they might gussy you up a bit. It's a lot of drab colors. Also, maybe, you won't kill me now.
 ASHLEY: I'm not going to kill you.
 SAM: I know, I gave you the flowers.
 ASHLEY: All right, well.
 SAM: Girls like flowers.
 LAURA: I love flowers, did you get me any?
 SAM: I didn't, because you're less of a threat. 
 LAURA: You don't know that. 
 ASHLEY: That was very nice of you, thank you.
 SAM: Sure!
 MARISHA: Didn't peg you for a flowers type of girl. 
 SAM: All girls like flowers
 ASHLEY: I take out a book that I have and in between some of the pages is a four leaf clover. I'll take the flowers and I'll put them in between the other pages, and I'll put it away.
 SAM: You see?
 (laughter)
 SAM: It doesn't hurt to be nice sometimes.
 MARISHA: I mean, it can though.
 SAM: Well it hurts *you*.
 LIAM: It looks like someone was very nice to you the night before, over and over again.
 MARISHA: Oh, she was.
 LAURA: You guys, we are going to Zadash. Is that what we're saying, we're going to go to Zadash?
 LIAM: Sure, let's do that. What's our goal in Zadash?
 LAURA: I don't know, I just need to know where we're going, okay?
 MARISHA: That's on the way to the "Solstrice" Academy?
 MATT: The Soltryce. Solstice, I can see you mixing it up. The Soltryce is technically in Rexxentrum, which is the capital of the empire.
 LAURA: Which is a lot farther.
 MATT: Which is a lot farther. Zadash does have the only other subsidiary of the academy there, but the main Soltryce academy is in Rexxentrum, the capital. But Zadash has some connection to it.
 TRAVIS: I'll take it.
 LIAM: Unless you're a foreigner, everyone knows about Rexxentrum.
 MATT: Yes, it's huge. For player comparison, it's twice the size of Emon. It's a massive city.
 LAURA: Zadash?
 MATT: No, not Zadash, Rexxentrum.
 LIAM: Zadash is medium, or smaller.
 LAURA: Okay. Yeah.
 LIAM: How far up did that map say, when I looked at it? 200 miles you said to Zadash?
 MATT: To Zadash, roughly 200 miles or so, if you're taking the road, quicker if you take a straight line, but you're not as safe.
 LIAM: Well, I think it's good.
 SAM: Are we going to walk there? Should we get horses?
 TALIESIN: We have a horse.
 LIAM: How many horses?
 TALIESIN: We have a horse. 
 MARISHA: A horse and a carriage. I'm assuming it can't fit all of us. 
 TRAVIS: Yeah, like a wagon. 
 TALIESIN: We have a wagon.
 MATT: It'll be about the same pace as on foot, at a fast pace on foot, you guys can traverse about 30 miles a day. That also means you're moving at a fast pace, so you're not being completely aware of your surroundings, you have a penalty to passively seeing things around you. But you get there quicker.
 TRAVIS: I like it.
 TALIESIN: Why be fast? What are we in a rush for?
 LAURA: We can sightsee.
 TALIESIN: I find careful is always best.
 LIAM: A couple of weeks on the road to a city bigger than this one.
 MARISHA: Are we all going to get along for a couple of weeks?
 SAM: We'll find out, I suppose. 
 LAURA: I get along with everyone, Beau.
 MARISHA: That's true, that's true.
 TALIESIN: I don't get along with anybody.
 MARISHA: That's also true.
 LIAM: Two weeks is not a bad test run for companions. If we don't like it, we part ways in Zadash.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, free to go at any time. As long as it serves everyone, we'll stay this way. 
 ASHLEY: I think I need to stay here just a little bit longer. But I will meet you guys there at some point?
 SAM: Why?! What’re you doing?
 LIAM: You have something else to do?
 ASHLEY: I just don't think I can leave here until, I'm told I can.
 SAM: By the authorities?
 ASHLEY: No, I just--
 SAM: You're so mysterious
 ASHLEY: I have things that I need to do--
 SAM: Name one.
 TALIESIN: You know where we're headed.
 MATT: Blindspot. 
 MARISHA: Poor Ashley, we make her come up with excuses every time.
 ASHLEY: I have reasons, I can stay, I just need to converse with someone to see where my next step leads. 
 MARISHA: You know you're not beholden to Gustav anymore, right?
 ASHLEY: No, yes, no. It's not him.
 MARISHA: Is it Bo? The other Bo? Is it Desmond?
 ASHLEY: No.
 MARISHA: Is it Ornna?
 SAM: Please, Beau, let the detectives figure this out. Is it Desmond?
 LAURA: Is it Ornna?
 SAM: It's Ornna isn't it? It's Ornna, I knew it.
 LAURA: Will you hold this?
 SAM: Yes, of course. See? Another case cracked. It was Ornna.
 LAURA: Before we leave, is there anywhere in town that there would be a courier service where I can send a message?
 MATT: There are messenger services, yeah.
 LAURA: Can I go find one?
 MATT: Yeah, okay. For the purposes of brevity, we'll say that you find a courier service that runs fast horseback all along the roads from the Empire and then with approval, outside of it, south and west.
 LAURA: I'm going to write a letter to my mother that says, "Dear Mom, all of the money's gone. I don't know what happened, but I am very broke and I need more. Please help me. I am going to Zadash. That's where you can send it. Just send it to the inn that is the biggest one and I'll find it there. Just address it to me. Your loving daughter, Jester. Please, thank you, I need help, thank you."
 MATT: All right. For delivery to Nicodranas, the cost of the courier service will run you about five gold.
 LAURA: This is really fucking-- She better send money, because this is eating into it.
 MATT: That's hundreds and hundreds of miles on horseback.
 LAURA: Okay, I'll give the five gold for that.
 TALIESIN: It is such a different world.
 MATT: Yeah. Welcome to level three, after tonight.
 SAM: Oh! If we live.
 MARISHA: While we're stopping by the post office, can I talk to the courier person?
 MATT: Sure. It's a young girl with short-ish brushed hair, she's boy-ish and freckled, and a bit dirty in the edges of her chin, she's in the process of loading up the packs on the horse, and she's wearing simple leather armor, and looks back at you, "Can I help you?"
 MARISHA: Yeah, I was just wondering if you had any incoming mail for the Baumbauch's? I said that I would pick it up on the way home, heading over there.
 MATT: Make a deception check.
 TALIESIN: Wow.
 SAM: Mail fraud on the way out of town.
 MARISHA: That's good! 20. No. Deception? 19 total.
 MATT: "Let me check. Yeah, actually, we got three small parcels on the way to the Baumbauch's there."
 MARISHA: Thank you so much. He's going to be so happy to not have to run this errand. Thank you, bye. Oh, sorry, here you go. I give her a gold.
 MATT: "That's very kind, thank you."
 MARISHA: Have a good day.
 MATT: Hops onto the horse and takes off southward.
 TALIESIN: Mail fraud.
 MARISHA: Let's go.
 TALIESIN: That is actually the worst crime we've committed today.
 MARISHA: You said how many? Three parcels?
 MATT: Three parcels.
 ASHLEY: When you get to Zadash, maybe send me a note, or maybe I'll be there. I just have to do a couple things.
 LAURA: We'll send you a note on the way to Zadash. Then maybe you can meet us there.
 ASHLEY: Okay. That sounds like a plan.
 TRAVIS: Do we have our fucking wagon ready?
 TALIESIN: Wagon's ready. I even attempted to hide some of the contraband and otherwise. I packed well.
 LIAM: While everyone is getting ready, I wait for a moment when Fjord is on his own and everyone is busy, walk over. This group seems rough around the edges, but you seem clever. Hopefully we can make this work.
 TRAVIS: I think we should be able to, yeah. I mean, a little guidance goes a long way. You seem to be good at looking out for Nott.
 LIAM: I mean, full disclosure, I'm a little rough around the edges, but you catch my drift.
 TRAVIS: I do. You can trust us. You're safe here. I'm concerned with what happens with Jester and Beau. I think amongst all of us, we should be fine.
 LIAM: Let's make it work.
 TRAVIS: We'll make it work.
 SAM: Fjord, something in me says that, for some reason, you should be the one who tells the horses and wagon to go.
 (laughter)
 SAM: It just seems, you're the biggest, maybe?
 TRAVIS: That is mighty considerate of you, Nott. Are you sure you don't want to take a crack at it?
 SAM: I could take a crack at it. The wagons be hitched, hee-haw.
 TRAVIS: Use your diaphragm. Really get a yee-haw, get in there.
 SAM: Saddle up your doggies, hee-haw.
 TRAVIS: One more time, on the count of three. One, two, three. On three, I push his chest in.
 SAM: Yee-haw!
 MATT: All right. With that, her vocal expulsion is majestic and sudden. Make an animal handling check with advantage, please.
 SAM: With advantage? Six. I'm still a scary goblin.
 MATT: The sound that comes out is less of a "Yee-haw," and more of a screech sound. The horse immediately rises up and goes into a very heavy gallop, and the cart takes off ahead of you, and you all struggle to catch up for a bit. With that, you guys quickly try and saunter up heading northward along the road toward the direction of Alfield, and eventually Zadash, as you head further into the Dwendalian Empire, and whatever fate has in store for you the next leg of your journey. We'll top tonight's session there.
 SAM: Ashley Johnson, ladies and gentlemen.
 LIAM: Yee-haw.
 ALL: Yee-haw.
 TRAVIS: Well, we committed felonies and mail fraud. That's good.
 TALIESIN: Quite a few. Got into a bar fight.
 LAURA: We skipped town without paying our inn fees.
 SAM: We bought drugs.
 TRAVIS: We bought a little bit of mold.
 MATT: You paid your inn fee.
 LAURA: We did pay on the way in. I did pay for a few days when we got in. I guess that is probably enough. 
 LIAM: Oh my gosh, and Sneaky McSneakerson over here. Oh boy.
 SAM: Oh, yeah. Who knows what Marisha did while we were out there.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, we got to go back and not watch that later.
 MARISHA: Like the three rules of Fight Club.
 MATT: You guys are all level three when you come back next week.
