Part I Edit 
 MATT: Welcome back. Last we left off, The Mighty Nein, the intrepid adventurers, had completed their task they had achieved from the King's Hall Taskboard to eliminate this spider scourge that had seemingly clogged up a portion of the sewers, discovered a subtle passage into the more upper class elements of the city, managed to extract some information from an individual they had saved from the webbing there, got your reward for it, had a conversation with Ulog of the Knights of Requital, who had discussed interest in possibly bringing you in for some endeavor.
 SAM: What's his name?
 LAURA: Ulog.
 MATT: Ulog. You had also, as the evening progressed, finished your night checking out The Evening Nip, a tavern that seemed extremely shady. Having some piss-poor ale, you had just exited the exterior of the tavern's location, out into the midnight evening air of Zadash, still a bit bruised and beaten from the battle earlier in the day, but eager to continue with what your next endeavor is. Mighty Nein, what would you like to do?
 TRAVIS and MARISHA: Nein!
 LAURA: I'm tired. This was a long day. Are you guys going to keep drinking?
 TRAVIS: Well, not in that fucking place, shit! Somewhere better.
 MARISHA: Are we making our way back?
 TRAVIS: Yeah, I think so.
 MARISHA: Okay, let's go back.
 LAURA: Going to just drink at the Leaky Tap.
 SAM: Or just go to sleep.
 LAURA: I guess we won't sleep at the fancy place tonight.
 SAM: It seems like it's too much work.
 TALIESIN: Bit of a pain in the ass.
 LAURA: It's a pain in the butt.
 SAM: Also, was there anything special about the room?
 LAURA: Nope, it was just kind of fancy.
 SAM: Just a bed?
 LAURA: Mm-hmm.
 SAM: No treats or anything?
 LAURA: There was a minibar, but I think you had to pay a lot of gold for each little thing of it.
 TRAVIS: Probably one of those ones, too, where you pick it up and it fucking automatically charges you. Dicks.
 SAM: Magic.
 MARISHA: Is that a thing?
 TRAVIS: Yeah, they're little seals, little arcane seals underneath it. You pick it up and try to put it back, but the seal's gone.
 MARISHA: The greed of the Crown, man.
 TRAVIS: Yep.
 MATT: As the evening rain fall begins to fall a bit harder, from the soft drizzle to a decent pour, you hear the distant rolling and crackling of thunder, as a storm front has slowly brought its way in as the night has progressed.
 LAURA: Hey! It's like we don't even have to bathe, now.
 MARISHA: I love the rain.
 TRAVIS: You know, if we're just going back. Pumat Sol, what was the name of his spot?
 MARISHA and LAURA: It was--
 SAM: A soul asylum?
 TRAVIS: No, it wasn’t.
 SAM: That would’ve been a cool name, though.
 LIAM: Invulnerable Vagrant.
 TRAVIS: Oh, yeah. How far away is the Invulnerable Vagrant?
 MATT: From where you are now, exiting the Evening Nip, it's maybe a 20 minute, 30 minute walk to the middle of the Pentamarket.
 TRAVIS: Is it late evening, like pre-midnight, or?
 MATT: It's pretty late evening, it's pushing on midnight, yeah.
 TRAVIS: You know what, never mind, I'll do it another day.
 LAURA: Should we go to sleep?
 MARISHA: Let's go to sleep.
 TALIESIN: Sleep, yes.
 MATT: You guys make your way back to the Leaky Tap, heading up to your rooms, and eventually find yourselves falling to sleep. However, the distant thunder rolls continue to quake the muffled interior of the rooms you're at, the lightning strikes flashing through the rooms that have a respective window, and the heavy impacts, causing you to wake up in the middle of the evening at times, with a restless bit of sleep. A faint drip of wayward rain collected and found its way through the roof of Beau and Jester's room, and the pattering in the corner of this small, building puddle, causes you to frustratingly go and collect it, find something to at least keep it from making that noise throughout the evening.
 LAURA: We should fold up a blanket and put it under there, it muffles the noise.
 MARISHA: Okay, that's a good idea. I hate ticking, or repetitive noises. That's so obnoxious.
 LAURA: Like (tapping).
 MARISHA: That. Exactly like that.
 LAURA: Or like, (clicking).
 MARISHA: That counts as well.
 LAURA: Yeah, I bet that would be annoying if you didn't like it.
 MARISHA: Yeah.
 LAURA: But it's not like (squeaking noises).
 LIAM: Keep going.
 MARISHA: The same umbrella category, yeah.
 LAURA: Okay.
 MATT: As you guys are having this conversation--
 SAM: That's a conversation?
 MATT: Loosely. By definition.
 MARISHA: We just woke up, we're real tired, okay?
 MATT: Mid-wee hours of the morning, you catch a quick glance at Yasha staring out the window at the storm, quietly sitting on the floor.
 MARISHA: Jesus.
 LAURA: Yasha.
 MATT: She glances over. "Yeah?"
 LAURA: I didn't even know you were in the room with us!
 MARISHA: You're super spooky at night, you know that?
 MATT: "Yeah, I get that."
 MARISHA: You're a little pale, so you have this ghostly quality to you. I don't know why I'm whispering.
 LAURA: Yeah, we're all awake.
 MARISHA: We're all awake now.
 LAURA: I sit down next to her and I show her some of my drawings to the Traveler that I did before I went to bed. Look, Yasha, it's rat balloons. I show her a little drawing I did.
 SAM: They really are rat balloons.
 LAURA: Little rat balloons, and one of them exploding with poison coming out of it.
 MATT: You see a hint of a smile at the edge of her lips, and she gives a nod. "That's pretty good. I could never draw."
 LAURA: No? Do you want me to draw you right now? I’ll do it, okay!
 MATT: You see her pull back a bit. Another flash, a nearby bolt causes the sky to light up. Yasha's unfazed, and her attention shifts back to the glass of the window again, a brief moment of trance-like attention before, "You should try to sleep."
 LAURA: Okay.
 MARISHA: You all right?
 MATT: She gives a nod and sits back down, closes her eyes, still sitting in a meditative position on the ground.
 LAURA: I draw her lit up by the lightning and then I go to sleep.
 MATT: Okay. Eventually, you all come to consciousness again, sore from the action of the previous day, but the daylight greets you, muddled as it is from the darkened grey raining skies that greet you. The thunderstorm is still passing through, and a quick glance out through the window into the main thoroughfare, you can see the streets are muddied, and in some places gathered into small pools and flooded puddles, but Yasha is gone.
 MARISHA: Maybe she was a ghost the whole time!
 LAURA: Maybe the lightning exploded her.
 MARISHA: That's heavy metal.
 LAURA: Yeah. Maybe she wandered out into the rain and lost her memory.
 MARISHA: That's a possibility.
 SAM: Does that happen?
 LAURA: Doesn't it?
 SAM: Does that happen?
 LAURA: It seems possible.
 SAM: I knew I didn't like the water.
 MARISHA: She probably just took off to handle some Yasha business, right, though?
 LAURA: Probably. We should ask Molly.
 MARISHA: We'll ask Molly.
 TRAVIS: Are we still in our rooms, or are we downstairs?
 MATT: That's up to you guys.
 SAM: Downstairs.
 MARISHA: We go downstairs.
 LAURA: Yeah.
 MATT: You all gather in the main area.
 SAM: I just came to borrow some butter. I was making something in my room.
 LIAM: I got up early to use a ritual to bring Frumpkin back, I have enough supplies to bring Frumpkin back one time.
 MATT: Easy enough to do.
 LAURA: What are your hit points this time?
 LIAM: I'm not here. Oh, let's find out.
 LAURA: Yeah, I want to know.
 LIAM: That's a three.
 MARISHA: That's better!
 MATT: That is better.
 LAURA: That's at least two kicks.
 (laughter)
 TRAVIS: (boom) (exhale) Damn it.
 MATT: You guys gather back in the tavern downstairs. You slept in a little, pushing like nine or ten at this point, but it is still gray and rainy outside. You can see carts making their way through the mud, some getting stuck and having to pull through, the beasts of burden trying to make their way through. The tavern interior is fairly light, not a lot of people in there, a few folks that are rushing through to grab a quick bite and leaving or having a drink in the face of a rather dreary day. But the room is yours. What do you wish to do?
 LAURA: I'm eating a carrot, you guys figure it out.
 SAM: Did they say they had more jobs for us to do?
 TRAVIS: I believe they said there would be more, I mean, we don't really have anything until this evening, remember there's that meeting that we have.
 SAM: Where is the meeting?
 TRAVIS: It's going to take place in the cellar.
 SAM: Do we have a plan for how we're going to-- what if they're taking you downstairs to ritually sacrifice you, or something?
 TRAVIS: You guys are going to join this time.
 SAM: We're all going?
 TRAVIS: Well, you don't all have to come. Some can stay above. I just wanted to put the invite out there.
 MARISHA: We were talking about a couple people watching out front, right? 
 LAURA: I will watch. I'm really good at keeping watch.
 LIAM: I will go with you, and Frumpkin will go with you. 
 SAM: Oh, so I'm going in to the belly of the beast? Sure. I'll disguise myself! I'll be just like Fjord. They'll think it's Fjord down there!
 TRAVIS: You know, I wanted to talk to you about your Fjord disguise. It is just a little obvious.
 LAURA: It's really good.
 TALIESIN: Too good.
 LIAM: Honestly, it's very cute. 
 LAURA: You look just like him only slightly shorter.
 SAM: That's the first time I've ever done that spell. I was very impressed with myself.
 TRAVIS: I would want to see what your range was, in case you wanted to, I don't know, perhaps mimic one of our other companions.
 TALIESIN: A total stranger would also be very useful.
 MARISHA: Someone from your deepest imagination.
 TALIESIN: Someone short.
 SAM: See, that's too many options, when you can appear to look like anything! I need to focus! If I get lost in thinking, "What nose should I have? Bulbous, pointy, or patrician nose?" That could take hours to decide!
 TALIESIN: Right there, patrician! That's perfectly fair right there.
 SAM: So a patrician nose?
 TALIESIN: Yes! See? One problem already solved.
 SAM: What kind of eyes? What color? Blue, black, brown, green?
 MARISHA: Green's pretty.
 TRAVIS: Maybe just one of them. Maybe you've got a patch over the other.
 TALIESIN: That's too many new options.
 SAM: A patch on one eye? What else do I have?
 MARISHA: Maybe you have a cleft chin.
 LAURA: Ooh, yes, butt chin! Those are always good! Ooh yes, and give yourself red hair.
 SAM: Red hair, green eyes, big patrician nose, cleft chin--
 LIAM: We're getting into Mr. Potato Head territory. I think maybe a simple halfling woman.
 LAURA: With red hair and a big patrician nose--
 TRAVIS: Bald on top and red hair on the sides.
 MARISHA: Yeah. And very curly! 
 SAM: All right.
 LIAM: They are pulling your leg.
 TRAVIS: Overalls with polka dots and a real big bow tie. And shoes bigger than you should be wearing!
 SAM: I feel like you're describing a specific person.
 TRAVIS: No! Not at all!
 (laughter)
 LAURA: Ooh, that sounds really attractive.
 TRAVIS: Just mull it over. Add it to your--
 SAM: I'll think about that one.
 TRAVIS: You’re rolling your mind’s Rolodex.
 TALIESIN: This is going to pay off at some point in the future.
 LAURA: Molly.
 TALIESIN: Yes?
 LAURA: Yasha's gone.
 TALIESIN: Did Yasha take off?
 MARISHA: Yeah, she did that thing again.
 LAURA: She was staring at the storm, and then she went away.
 MARISHA: Does she sleep?
 TALIESIN: Well, yeah, she sleeps.
 MARISHA: She's a little creepy. In like, a hot way, but a little creepy.
 LAURA: Like in a protector, I felt safe when she was standing watch sort of way.
 MARISHA: Yeah, kind of.
 TALIESIN: Yeah, she does that.
 MARISHA: It's very mysterious.
 TALIESIN: She's good. She's just got some personal issues that's she's going through.
 LIAM: It's hard to get a bead on her because she always takes up and leaves.
 TALIESIN: It takes time. 
 MARISHA: Yeah, we all have personal issues.
 TALIESIN: I assure you; she's worth it. She'll be back in her own time.
 SAM: You seem normal.
 MARISHA: Who? You?
 SAM: All of us.
 MARISHA: Us?
 LAURA: We're very normal!
 SAM: Sure!
 TALIESIN: Are you sure?
 LAURA: I mean, you're weird. We already established that.
 TALIESIN: Yeah, no, please, let's not start calling names!
 LIAM: Yes, Jester, also you have a very nice personality, but it is a big one.
 LAURA: What does that have to do with anything? 
 LIAM: Well, just what you were just talking about.
 SAM: He didn't mean it like that. Sometimes he's very honest with people.
 MARISHA: Yeah. It did seem very pointed and targeted.
 LIAM: That's because I was speaking to you, Jester, sitting in front of me! You made the windows--
 LAURA: I use Thaumaturgy to open all the windows like this!
 MATT: They all slam open loudly! Wind and rain begins to suddenly pour in from the side, from the wind blowing it through. All of a sudden, the few folks that are in there freak out. 
 LAURA: Oh, this storm is so crazy! 
 MATT: (wind howling)
 TALIESIN: Thaumaturgy to close the windows, maybe?
 MARISHA: See, I'm having a hard time myself getting through to Caleb, so I feel like it's hard for an asshole to teach an asshole. 
 TRAVIS: Sometimes having a pupil teaches you something about yourself. Just saying.
 MARISHA: I should punch him in the face?
 TRAVIS: Give it a shot.
 LIAM: I am sitting right next to you.
 MARISHA: I was having a side conversation! 
 LIAM: It's a small room.
 TALIESIN: This is terrifying, but I think the three most even-keel, normal of us should go to the meeting. I don't think that the three of us necessarily would be appropriate company.
 LAURA: We might stand out a little too much. It would be easy to recognize us as part of a meeting like that. You're green, but mostly you look pretty normal outside of that.
 TRAVIS: Thanks, Jester. I appreciate that. 
 LIAM: We'll switch it around, then? Maybe Nott, you go with Jester. You stay up top, and I will go to this meeting. Frumpkin will stay with you.
 SAM: Sure. Yes.
 TALIESIN: This works for me.
 TRAVIS: You're not going to do the cloudy-eye thing when you're down in the meeting though, right?
 LIAM: No, because I wouldn't be able to hear what they are saying or know what they look like. This one said she wants to punch me in the head. I don't want that to happen.
 TRAVIS: You go all static channel on us, we might be in deep shit.
 MARISHA: You can learn a lot of things from being punched in the face.
 LIAM: I have done that.
 LAURA: What do you want to do when we're supposed to be keeping watch? 
 TALIESIN: I don't know. There's so many options! 
 LAURA: We could find a candy store. 
 TALIESIN: Are there any candy stores? There are stores that specifically sell candy? 
 LAURA: There were in Nicodranas.
 LIAM: Are we talking about drugs again? 
 TALIESIN: We could be.
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: Never mind, you have a meeting to go to. The rest of us are going to have some fun.
 TRAVIS: That's not until this evening, right? 
 MATT: Yeah, it's an evening meeting.
 LAURA: Did you want to go see Enchanter Pumat Sol? 
 TRAVIS: Yeah, I do. I enjoyed his company so much last time. Feel like we've got a little more coin to spend, might be smart to stock up on items.
 MARISHA: Maybe we can also take the day to ask around and get a little bit more of a bead on the opinions of the locals on the current political climate.
 LAURA: I have to return my key to the Pillow Trove. 
 TRAVIS: Why?
 LAURA: Because I have a key to The Pillow Trove. They're going to keep charging me a room until I give it back.
 TRAVIS: Oh. Thought your mom was going to pay for it.
 TALIESIN: That's assuming the money shows up in time. 
 TRAVIS: Oh, good point.
 LAURA: Well, yes. Eventually she will pay for it. I don't want to waste all of the money she sends on paying for the room, you know? 
 TRAVIS: That's very smart of you, Jester.
 LAURA: I'm trying to be smarter.
 TRAVIS: Should we set out to our various tasks, then? 
 MARISHA: You're very smart, Jester.
 LAURA: Thank you, Beau. 
 LIAM: I will tag along with you again, because I still have--
 LAURA: Because now you have a fancy coat!
 LIAM: Well, it's functional. 
 MATT: Do you all divide into your various endeavors?
 SAM: Sure. To the fancy place? 
 LIAM: No, you go to Pumat's, I think. I don't know. I just haven't split up with you a lot lately. 
 TRAVIS: I’m going to the Invulnerable Vagrant! 
 TALIESIN: I have not actually seen this Pumat, so I would love to actually take a look.
 TRAVIS: Yeah! You will love him.
 LAURA: Oh! He's so wonderful. 
 LIAM: You and me. 
 SAM: I'm coming with you, Fjord.
 TRAVIS: Oh, that's three! Do I hear four? Four? Four? (speeds into auction chant)
 (laughter) 
 TRAVIS: That's my auctioneer! 
 MARISHA: Are you going? 
 LIAM: No, I am going with Jester to this fancy place.
 MARISHA: You're going to the fancy place.
 TALIESIN: Or with us, we're going to go shopping.
 SAM: Unless you want to go with your protégé there. 
 MARISHA: He's going with Jester. Yeah, I'll go with you guys.
 LAURA: That's our new bodyguard.
 LIAM: You are the muscle. She's the muscle. You guys are the muscle. I am not the muscle. 
 MATT: As you guys divide into your two separate groups, scattering this side, these three heading over towards the Tri-Spire. The other three of you guys are heading towards the Pentamarket.
 TRAVIS: Can I grab my Mariner's studded leather armor out of my room and bring it with?
 MATT: You may. 
 MARISHA: Along the way, can I look for a tailor?
 MATT: Sure! Make an investigation check. What kind of tailor are you looking for, a standard clothing tailor?
 MARISHA: Fucking balls. Seven. Someone who can sew me a custom coat, a cloak, or add a lining to something like that. 
 LIAM: I could take you back to where I bought this cloak yesterday, if you want to go there.
 MATT: It won't take terribly long. It takes you a little longer. Although if you're going to the same place he's already been to, then it completely circumvents that.
 MARISHA: Do they do custom there?
 MATT: You go and inquire. They do custom work, but it takes a little bit of time. It's a little pricier as opposed to buying one off the rack. 
 MARISHA: That's fine.
 MATT: It will take about a day for them to finish the work on it, and it will run you about two silver.
 MARISHA: Done. 
 MATT: If you're providing the cloak. Were you having a custom one made? Are you having a liner put in, or having a custom cloak made?
 MARISHA: I would like to take one of their cloaks and have a blue liner put on the inside to make it reversible.
 MATT: Okay, yeah. Full purchase of the cloak, and that'll put you about four silver for the full cloak. That includes the work, the lining addition, and the time waiting for it.
 MARISHA: Like one of those baggier, poncho coats. One of those?
 MATT: Okay, so hooded cloak and the front and the back with slits for arms to come through. Got it. You have that ordered. It'll be ready by midday tomorrow, they're saying.
 MARISHA: Thank you, sir!
 MATT: You guys are going to make your way to the Pentamarket. At this point in time, it is still a fairly moderate downpour through the day. As you begin to come through, some of the carts are closed in the middle of the market: the ones that are more open that sell fresh goods or things that can be ruined by rainwater and that don't have quite as strong of a canopy, but there are some that are still open. They have hooded lanterns out to draw attention towards them, you have barkers shouting out, "Meats, fresh meats!" and trying to get your attention over there, but you guys maneuver through, making a beeline to your location. Eventually you come up to the warm-looking, dark wood exterior of the Vulnerable Vagrant facility.
 TRAVIS: (mutters) Vulnerable? Thought it was the Invulnerable.
 MATT: The Invulnerable.
 TRAVIS: Oh, got it.
 SAM: Is it open?
 MATT: It appears to be. The doors are closed, but it is warm on the inside, and upon checking the door, it is not locked.
 TRAVIS: Nice. We go in.
 MATT: You step inside the interior and there is one other patron, who is currently in the process of looking through one of the glass cases in the far end of the room. You can see it’s a rather portly looking gentleman, probably middle-aged or so. His hair is curled and unkempt, but pulled close to his scalp. His cheeks are ruddy, like the cold weather has caused him to get a bit flush, and he's in the process of glancing over as soon as you enter. He looks sidelong to your troupe as you enter and tries to mind his own business. There across the room, you can see there are two Pumat Sols currently, one of them smiling and looking out your direction, the other one that is keeping an eye on the gentleman in the corner. The one that watches you enter gives a big grin, "Why hello there!"
 TRAVIS: Good to see you again! Boy, it is sure coming down outside, wish there was a way to dry off real fast. 
 MATT: "Well, if that's what you're asking, I would be happy to help you."
 TRAVIS: I am!
 MATT: He walks on over and starts breathing heavily on you.
 (laughter)
 TRAVIS: (quietly) Fuck. (clears throat) What does it smell like?
 MATT: His breath is warm. There are elements of an herbal scent that immediately is overtaken with a--
 TRAVIS: Sour cream and onion chips.
 MATT: Yeah, it's not entirely unpleasant, but not pleasant either. It's a warm cow-breath smell.
 LAURA: Oh, I want to pet a cow so bad right now, you guys.
 TRAVIS: We'll see what we can do.
 MATT: As he takes a deep breath on you once or twice, you feel your body warm up for a moment as he finishes the Prestidigitation cantrip and you are suddenly, immediately dry.
 TRAVIS: That is much better! Thank you, Pumat! That is wonderful!
 MATT: "It is, quite literally, the least I can do."
 TRAVIS: I had a question for you: we found this armor down in the sewers and it seems to have some--
 MATT: "Oh, that's really pretty."
 TRAVIS: Right, yeah!
 MATT: "Yeah, no, that's really pretty."
 TRAVIS: Have you seen this armor before?
 MATT: "Haven't seen that kind, no, but I like the designs on it. It's really pretty."
 TRAVIS: Yeah, here's the thing. I spent a lot of time by the water when I was growing up, and when you live by the water, too much water theme in your design is overkill. You know, it's like the person that has the beach house and everything is shells and water and lobsters--
 MATT: "Yeah, no, that's just a faux pax, socially."
 TRAVIS: Yeah. I feel like this has some unique properties to it. Is there a chance that I could, I don't know, in some way transfer or copy some of that onto what I'm currently wearing? I have a little bit more intrinsic value with what I have.
 MATT: "Let me go ahead and have a look at it, if you wouldn't mind. There we go, there's a few other pieces right there if you want to hand them over--"
 TRAVIS: They're not really attached, I'm sorry.
 MATT: "No, it's all right. Oh, that's a full set!"
 TRAVIS: I don't know if shells fall out, so be careful.
 MATT: "I appreciate that heads up. Hey, mind helping me, me?" The other Pumat goes, "Oh yeah, no worries. Pardon me, sir, I'll be right back. Me, could you watch him?" The other one comes around the corner, "Oh yeah, no worries." Now the third one has entered the room and is looking-- this is a very strange sight for ye who has not been within the store first.
 TRAVIS: I forgot to tell you, there are multiple versions of Pumat. Apparently the other ones are called "Me me."
 MATT: The one who's at the back is like, "Well we only refer to each other as "me." As we're all technically the same individual. There is a Pumat Prime, but he's currently not in the main chamber. Oh, I haven't seen you around. What's your name there fellow?"
 TALIESIN: Oh hello, Molly, hello.
 MATT: "Molly, hello to you as well."
 TALIESIN: Pleasure, charmed.
 MATT: "Yeah." You see as the mass of curled hair around the somewhat pointed furred ears that curl back. The large smile under the broad nose. Very--
 LAURA: Attractive?
 MATT: Oh, he's just a pleasant, jolly individual who is massive in size, even with a slight hunch around the shoulders and back, stands a full seven feet, probably.
 TALIESIN: If it's all right, I'm going to peruse a bit.
 MATT: "Oh yeah, no worries. Just be wary of anything you're planning to touch over there. Oh and you, you're just an adorable little friend there."
 SAM: Yes, it's nice to see you again, Mr. Sol.
 MATT: "Yeah."
 SAM: Well, I'll let Fjord finish. But I have a request as well.
 MATT: "Well, we're going to go ahead and take those in the order they've been received. So if you could respectfully have a moment to yourself there. We’ll help you as soon as we can. Thank you." He turns back around, and goes back to you--
 TRAVIS: Nott, hands in your pockets, all right?
 SAM: Don't worry.
 TRAVIS: Okay.
 MATT: As the two begin to look over, one of them is inspecting the quality of the armor while the other one closes his eyes and, as he begins to focus, you watch as this faint little flash emanates from the armor, briefly. He goes, "Oh, yeah, no; that there is a pretty simple enchantment right there. There are limitations based on the strength of the enchantment and how recently it's been applied to the equipment involved. But since this is a simple enchantment it is something possible to translocate onto a similar piece of equipment. It is a bit-- there is a cost to it should you be willing to pay for the service, but we can probably do that for you, yeah."
 TRAVIS: Is there any chance you can tell me how much it might cost?
 MATT: "Hold on just a second." He goes in the back room and you hear these two muffled (muffled conversation).
 TRAVIS: He's really very nice and accommodating.
 TALIESIN: Extremely accommodating.
 SAM: Knowledgeable, too, about all sorts of things.
 MATT: (muted laughter)
 TALIESIN: All of them.
 MATT: He comes back into the chamber. "So to have this enchantment transferred over, it's only going to cost you about 80 gold pieces."
 TRAVIS: I'm sorry, a little-- 80? Eight zero, or one eight, 18?
 MATT: "Eight zero gold pieces as it does require some components to both harness, extract, and maintain the enchantment when it is put over to the new piece of equipment."
 TRAVIS: Right. Okay, let me think on it a bit. Nott, you had a request?
 MATT: "We'll put a little pin in that one. You had a question there, little one?"
 SAM: Ah, yes. You sold my friend a haversack before, and it has these side pouches. Can you sell me a pouch, a little side pouch, just a little side pouchy thing?
 MATT: "(sighs) You see, unfortunately--"
 SAM: Drink cozy sort of a thing.
 MATT: "I mean, I can sell you a pouch. It's just going to be a normal pouch. Part of the haversack enchantment there is an all-encompassing object. We have others, if you'd like to buy one for yourself."
 SAM: Other haversacks?
 MATT: "Yeah."
 SAM: How much were they again?
 MATT: "For a return customer--" Do you have the card still on that one?
 LAURA: You charged me an additional 200, but that was also giving you the glaive.
 SAM: Oh.
 MATT: Right with the charge on it. I think the total cost was a little over a 1,000 gold. (laughs)
 LAURA: I got a good discount. That glaive was really nice, shit.
 MATT: It was a few hundred at least. I don't have the card in front of me. "Yeah, I--"
 LAURA: I have the card, but it doesn't say the cost. Ooh it does, 1,350! Fuck! Oh shit.
 SAM: I'm okay, then. That's fine. I don't need-- I thought that they could be broken up and sold in little sets.
 MATT: "I mean we could look into possibly devolving a small-based enchantment like that. I mean, research and development of that does take a while. You'd have to fund the endeavor. The good news is, when it's done you'd be the first to have an original Enchanter Pumat Sol pocket cozy pouch."
 (laughter)
 SAM: How much would that endeavor cost me?
 MATT: "I don't know, I'll be right back." He goes to the back room again. (muted conversation) Comes back out. "Pumat Prime in there says that for the process of research and development, should it be successful, development of the object, it'll probably be about two weeks of time of enchantment and the cost of the overall pouch will probably run you 200-250 gold pieces."
 TRAVIS: That's mighty good.
 LAURA: That's a pretty good deal compared to the--
 SAM: Yeah, but I'd just get the side pouch.
 LAURA: Yeah.
 SAM: I wouldn't get the full thing.
 LAURA: I mean, but still.
 TALIESIN: What are you going to put in it?
 MARISHA: So many things.
 LAURA: Buttons.
 SAM: A lot of buttons.
 LAURA: A regular pouch can hold a lot of buttons.
 SAM: That's true. I'll think on it. Can I ask you one more question, Pumat?
 MATT: "Of course."
 SAM: I don't mean to pry into your personal existence, but there seems to be many of you. Was that caused by magic? Did you do that? Is that an accident? Was that a splicing thing?
 MATT: The large looming figure of Pumat Sol shades over you and slowly comes down onto his knees. This lurching monolith over your tiny, goblin frame. The face gets tense for a second and pulls back into this very warm, toothy smile and goes, "Oh, I like an inquisitive little girl." Pats and rubs your head. The hand is like a giant mitt that almost encompasses your entire head.
 TRAVIS: You get a fucking concussion.
 MATT: "If you look over there." He points on the wall, you see a framed symbol. Three diamond shards that all point to the center a flux capacitor-like design. He goes, "I'm actually an annex of the Cerberus Assembly. So I get certain favors and I do things for them. I provide them, occasionally, with my capabilities and some enchanted objects and in return they were kind enough to provide me with, well me, and him, and him."
 SAM: So the Cerberus Assembly is that powerful with magic?
 MATT: "They're about the most powerful you find in the Empire, yeah. So me and my brothers here are actually, technically we're a Simulacrum."
 SAM: Oh. That's fascinating.
 MATT: "But you know, we do what we can."
 SAM: If someone were to want someone with that sort of magical power, you could not provide that, but the Cerberus Assembly could?
 MATT: "Well, I guarantee with enough positive reinforcement, with enough friendship attained with certain members like I have developed over many years of hard work and providing services, perhaps one day you too could be the fine owner of three other different versions of your tiny self."
 SAM: That's amazing. Are they a secretive group? Do they have a business card or anything?
 MATT: "Not much of a business card. They got members all over. Most of them are up in the capital, but there is one of them that runs that Hall of Erudition. Right over in the Tri-Spire."
 SAM: Thank you. Thank you for the information.
 MATT: "Of course, happy to help."
 TRAVIS: You know, Pumat, I think will take you up on that enchantment, 80 gold. It's a bit more than I was hoping to spend. I couldn't overhear you offering an incentive for being a return customer. I did enjoy, most recently, unfortunately, one of your healing potions. Perhaps if I purchased a healing potion and the transfer of the enchantments we could find some sort of a deal?
 MATT: Make a persuasion check.
 TRAVIS: Get it, get it boy. 12, It's not terrible.
 MATT: "I respect your candor. I see that you have a keen mind for business relationships. However, I do have to turn a profit. So I can't do much for you there, my apologies."
 TRAVIS: I understand. Healing potions were how much again? 70 gold?
 MATT: "No, those were 50 gold a piece."
 TRAVIS: 50 gold. Wow, I got to work on my fucking memory. Great, I will take a healing potion and the enchantment transfer, please.
 MATT: "Fair enough. That will will run you 100 and--"
 TRAVIS: 30.
 MATT: "30 gold pieces, that's correct. There's your healing potion. You get your basic one right there."
 TRAVIS: Okay, thank you.
 MATT: "It'll take about an hour to transfer this here enchantment for you. So be patient and come back in about 60 minutes. Should be ready to go."
 TRAVIS: Yeah, I take the breastplate part of my leather armor off and leave it with you.
 MATT: "Oh, this is-- want us to clean it for you?"
 TRAVIS: Yeah, that would be--
 TALIESIN: Yes, please clean it. Please.
 MATT: "All right."
 TRAVIS: It's not that bad. You don't have to act like it--
 TALIESIN: It was starting to-- it has a brine.
 MATT: "Would you prefer black ice, lavender or new leather?"
 TRAVIS: New leather.
 MATT: "New leather it is. I'll get it right to you."
 TRAVIS: That’s amazing.
 MATT: Turns around.
 TALIESIN: I've been doing a perusal by the way. Is there anything that's caught my eye in this--?
 MATT: Make an investigation check.
 TALIESIN: Make an investigation check. It's hard to concentrate, 13.
 MATT: Okay, there's a lot of things here. Many not anywhere near your price range.
 TALIESIN: Sure.
 MATT: There are three that catch your eye that are loosely interesting, at least between you and your allies. There is one pendant that has a darkened ivory spiral and almost a heart sculpture, but it is roughly sculpted.
 TALIESIN: Interesting.
 MATT: That is currently labeled with a fine ribbon at the bottom at 150 gold. It states that it has the capability of-- you can almost hear it in his voice after seeing and meeting him for this short time. "It's capable of insuring that if you take too many hits it will help prevent you bleeding out on your own."
 LAURA: That's good.
 MATT: "Also, when you take a rest, you get a little bit of a bonus when healing."
 TALIESIN: All right, that's interesting.
 MATT: There's one of them that's this darkened, orangeish, amber-colored orb or marble about that big. That is 350 gold.
 LAURA: Woah.
 MATT: The ribbon attached to that one states, "Should someone holding this have the capability of spinning spells one way or the other, they can probably keep one stored in this thing and release it at a later time."
 MARISHA: I had one of those last campaign.
 LAURA: That was a ring.
 MARISHA: That was a ring of holding, yeah. Good stuff.
 TALIESIN: The final piece that I noticed?
 MATT: Yes, this is a really beautiful cloak that has a purplish-blue color to it with very fine edged embroidery, gold and silver that naturally comes out of the cloak like it's growing silver vines at the edges of it. It's a very fine make. This one is labeled at 800 gold. "The donner of this cloak would find themselves largely protected in certain ways from the elements, or blows, or magics, or what have you."
 TALIESIN: Wow.
 LAURA: It's like a cloak of AC? No, like resistance?
 MATT: Cloak of protection.
 LAURA: Cloak of protection, like ring of protection.
 TRAVIS: It gives you some bonus.
 LAURA: Man, I want a ring of protection again.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, we all do.
 TALIESIN: We all do.
 TRAVIS: Super squishy-ass, crispy tacos.
 SAM: What if we kill all of Pumat Sol and come back and rob this place?
 TALIESIN: That's a great plan.
 MATT: That's an option.
 TRAVIS: I think you only have to kill the one.
 LIAM: Prime.
 TRAVIS: This conversation did not happen in the game by the way.
 MATT: Oh, I assumed.
 TALIESIN: What did we each make off--
 SAM: You should be tracking it in your DandD Beyond currency counter.
 LAURA: We didn't put that in our--
 SAM: I added my 100. We each got a 100.
 LAURA: Oh, I think I added it.
 MATT: Yeah, it was 700 gold.
 TALIESIN: Okay, so I did. So I can technically afford this.
 LAURA: Well, one of them.
 TALIESIN: I'd love to see that heart locket if you don't mind. This thing.
 LAURA: Did you spit on my thing--
 SAM: Probably, you made me laugh.
 MATT: There's the two guys are like, "Sorry, can't help you, we're in mid enchantment translocation. Could you help him?" The other one is like, "Yeah, no worries, I got you. Hey there, buddy, what you looking at over there for?"
 TALIESIN: Pleasure to meet you. I was looking at this piece right here.
 MATT: "Oh yeah, no. Let me pass you over a little more information about that. That's a periapt of wound closure, if you're so interested. It both allows you to stabilize when you hit zero hit points, and when you're using hit dice to heal up, it's a little bit nicer."
 LAURA: Is this like, if I'm healing him, does he still get the double hit points?
 MATT: "Just when it's doing hit dice."
 LAURA: Sorry.
 TRAVIS: Got to attune to it?
 SAM: Wound closure? You cut yourself all the time, that would be very useful.
 TALIESIN: They tend to sort of heal themselves, though. 
 LIAM: Is it reusable?
 TALIESIN: This is quite nice, oh yeah. You know I think I'm going to treat myself, I'm going to take it. I feel like I've earned something, we've had a good run of it and I have never spent this much money on anything in my life. 
 TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, we've got some good momentum now, right? What could possibly happen? 
 MATT: "Not going to lie, really appreciative to have, just here in a few days, returning customers willing to spend fine, hard earned gold on some finely crafted and enchanted objects."
 TALIESIN: I pass 150 gold. 
 MATT: "An absolute pleasure there, you say it was Mollyoop?"
 TALIESIN: Just Molly to my friends.
 MATT: "Molly it is."
 TALIESIN: This is wonderful. I'm going to add it to my other necklace.
 TRAVIS: It looks incredible. It's found a place.
 TALIESIN: I feel, it's right to my heart. Right there.
 TRAVIS: Pumat, before we go I wanted to ask you, I know that you're an annex of the Cerberus Assembly. How do you feel about the governing parties here in town? Are you happy with the way things are run?
 MATT: "I mean, overall it seems to be as fine as it can be."
 TRAVIS: Right.
 MATT: "You know, some folks don't have as much coin as others, but what can you do to really help them? We do what we can but there's a lot of dangerous things out there. We got all sorts of baddies coming over from Xhorhas, we got the possible encroaching of foreign powers always looking to peek over the mountain range and try and steal some of our hard earned materials. So I think it's good they keep us nice and safe and, I mean, I got myself a fine business, too."
 TRAVIS: Yeah. I think it's great that you support the barracks. Do they come in for regular purchases every week or every month or find themselves in your store more often than not? 
 MATT: "Who are you referring to?"
 TRAVIS: The members of the Cerberus Assembly.
 MATT: "Oh no, they don't come to the store often. They usually send requests, they make orders and I have them sent on over to either Rexxentrum or the Hall, if that's where they're going to be utilizing them."
 TRAVIS: That's wonderful. Well thank you, thank you for your time.
 MATT: "No worries. They're a fine bunch. They do a lot of good, they keep the Crown in check, they make sure there's no abuse of power and they also have been very staunch supporters of helping promote learning here in the smaller, more middle to lower classes here in Zadash."
 TRAVIS: Oh really? They're not as protective of certain knowledges as other parts of the government might be? 
 MATT: "Well, I mean, protective of knowledge in the sense that not everyone can be trusted with knowledge and, I’m not going to lie, some of the things even I know can be real dangerous in the wrong hands, so I think it's important there has to be a certain level of control. I've seen some really nutty people out there that I can't imagine what it would be like if we didn't have some sort of law and order."
 TRAVIS: But they might be a bit more open minded to people sharing in that knowledge if they were the right type of person?
 MATT: "Could very well be! They've been very kind to me."
 TRAVIS: I'm glad to hear that. Nott? Molly? You have everything you need? 
 SAM: Yes.
 TALIESIN: Yeah, I've been looking in the little mirror trying to get the height right.
 TRAVIS: Did you want to bring the mirror with you? 
 TALIESIN: Can I? 
 TRAVIS: I was joking.
 TALIESIN: Oh, that's right. Fine. This is good. Okay.
 SAM: We'll probably be back in like a day.
 TALIESIN: We'll be back.
 MATT: "Well, we'll be here. All four of us."
 SAM: Goodbye Pumats Sol.
 MATT: "Pleasure to meet you, little goblin lady!"
 TRAVIS: Give Pumat Prime our best. 
 MATT: "I will. Right now." He goes in the back room as the other two are still focusing on your armor. As you leave the two that are focusing go, "Thank you!" "Thank you!"
 TRAVIS: Fuck.
 MATT: You wait the better part of an hour, are able to retrieve your armor and indeed you now have the Mariner's armor enchantment on your breastplate.
 TRAVIS: Thank you for not making me stand out in the rain for an hour without top pieces. Thank you.
 MATT: Now, the three of you. So what means are you attempting to enter the Tri-Spires?
 LAURA: We go back to the gate, right?
 LIAM: Yeah. You know I had that bad time yesterday, but probably different guards there and I have this cloak now so I'm going to--
 LAURA: You look really-- can I? I'm going to brush your hair out of your face.
 LIAM: Yeah.
 LAURA: And like, wipe at any dirt off your face, okay? 
 LIAM: Oh, the rain has already taken care of most of that.
 LAURA: I know. Well, it's washed it off, but now I've got to get the smudges off. Because, you know, it's still kind of there.
 LIAM: Thank you. Is it good?
 LAURA: Well, you look sparkling clean! You look very dashing. 
 LIAM: We'll see if the guards think so, eh? 
 LAURA: Yes.Just keep your cloak really tight on you, okay?
 LIAM: That's the idea, yeah.
 MATT: You find yourselves to the exterior of the Tri-Spire, the familiar gate where you've traversed and failed to traverse once before. As you make your way towards the edge, you see the two guards once again, somewhat to the center to prevent entry. As you begin to walk up, you see three other figures are exiting the district and the guards stop, "Halt." Give a nod, recognizing the individuals as they walk past, they move on. They look to be fairly decently dressed, a male and a female. You don't know if they're married or not but they appear to be a couple. A friend of theirs is off to the side. All in cloaks, hoods up, very nice cloaks, thick but very well made as the rain is still coming down. They're all bundled up, but there is a point of recognition with the guards as they pass by. As they move beyond, the guards once again approach and they're like, "Halt." 
 LAURA: Oh, hello again.
 MATT: "Hello again."
 LAURA: Yes. We're making our way to the Pillow Trove. That's all.
 MATT: They both give a look over the two of you.
 MARISHA: I'm all nice and buttoned up. Belt tied.
 LIAM: I'm looking at the ground.
 MARISHA: Looking tough.
 MATT: For the sake of this, make a persuasion check, Jester.
 LAURA: Oh Jesus. Okay. That was not a lot of flourish there, but 17!
 TALIESIN: It went back to a 20. 
 LAURA: I know it did.
 MATT: "Come in." You guys quickly make your way through the open gates, under the portcullis, into the cobblestone streets of the Tri-Spire and there you see the Silken Terrace, the three towers that mark the central part of Zadash.
 LAURA: (giggles) We made it!
 LIAM: It's nice in here. 
 LAURA: I know, right?! Should we ask where the smutty shop is that you want to go to?
 LIAM: It has a name. It is called Chastity's Nook.
 MARISHA and LAURA: (laughter)
 LIAM: Yes, it's right in the name.
 MARISHA: It's a good name.
 LAURA: I go back to the guard and ask where the Chastity's Nook is.
 MATT: "I-- oh." He gives you this weird look as you ask him. He's like, "Actually it's right there in the Silken Terrace to the left of the large bakery. It's the hut-looking thing."
 LAURA: Thank you very much. I appreciate all of your help. You've been wonderful. Good bye. 
 MATT: "Of course," he says behind you as you rush off.
 SAM: A bakery *and* a porn shop? If they find a fight club, you guys are going to be orgasming!
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: To be fair, they make pornographic cakes there, so it's all right.
 MATT: It’s pretty great.
 TRAVIS: Oh, oh, oh!
 MATT: Bringing in an American Pie reference, wow. You enter the Silken Terrace. First off, the beautiful cobblestone streets before you are broken up by small patches of small fenced-in shrubbery and flower bushes. The whole interior here is such stark contrast to the rest of the city. It is both surprising and sickening knowing some of the harder lifestyles that exist on the outside of the walls here. There are a few large sights as you pass through here. There is one of the large towers here is part of the ivory and marble structure that has large blue banners that hang down the sides. The central tower itself fires up into the sky. This centerpiece-- and you've known this since you've been here before-- is known as the Zauber Spire.
 MARISHA: Zombra Spire--Zombra?
 MATT: Zauber Spire. Z-A-U-B-E-R S-P-I-R-E. The Zauber Spire. It is the central piece of the Halls of Erudition campus and lords over that entire section to the north side. It is the furthest tower here. There is an area that you've heard of, not been to, called the Gilded Willows, which is the tree-dappled residential area of the city. It's broken up into several pieces, but you see a lot of the treetops, and there is this very natural, almost picturesque beauty of the interior. 
 LIAM: What was that called again?
 MATT: The Gilded Willows. It's the broken up residential aspects of this area. 
 MARISHA: Okay, it's Bel-Air.
 MATT: Yeah. There is the Triumph Chime, which is a seven story temple and belfry that has been retrofitted as the previous-- and you would know this from learning your history lessons-- actually, make a history check. 
 MARISHA: Okay!
 TRAVIS: Maybe you know it.
 MATT: You might not remember it.
 MARISHA: It was so good, too! Almost! Did you see that? History? Six. 
 MATT: All right. You know that it's there. You know the three towers are there. There’s the Zauber Spire; the Constellation Bridge in the Gilded Willows, which is a giant watchtower that overlooks the entirety of this city; and then the last bit is the Triumph Chime, but that's all you know about them. 
 MARISHA: Yeah, it's, like, the Zauber Spire, the Constellation Bridge, and whatever the Triumph Tower is. Chime. I think it's a church. Or a cult. Or a church-turned-cult. I don't remember.
 LAURA: The Constellation Bridge sounds very pretty.
 MARISHA: It is.
 LIAM: It's a good name.
 MATT: As you continue in the direction of where you were guided, you come upon the very familiar scent of warm baked goods, both savory and sweet. It is relatively crowded. A lot of the folks are bundled up. They have large mittens on, heavy coats and cloaks and a lot of the general elite that live in this vicinity have come here to pick up warm goods to help go against the cold rain that's now coming down upon the city. To the right of that, towards the very edge of this road of various shops and market bits, there is a building that is small with a thatched roof, like it's more for the visual aspect of it. It's made to look almost like a small country cottage but it's plainly intentional and is an aesthetic that's been placed onto it to make it look different and interesting from the rest of the--
 MARISHA: Like a tiki bar!
 MATT: Yeah, I guess you could say that. Outside you do see a sign that is written in beautiful cursive that's arched over the main door that says “Chastity's Nook.” The doorway is slightly open, and there is a warm light from the interior. There is a glass window. There are books on display there, but you already see a few people inside. It's not packed, but it's making business. What do you guys want to do?
 LIAM: Just before we head that way, just out of curiosity, what is the name of the bakery that is near?
 MATT: You actually can't see the name from the outside. You'd have to go and ask.
 LIAM: I go and ask. I walk into the-- come, are you hungry? 
 LAURA: I always am hungry!
 LIAM: Okay, I will get us some sweets if you want. 
 LAURA: Really?
 LIAM: Yeah, sure, why not? We are flush at the moment. I walk in.
 MATT: Easy enough to ask. As you walk inside, there is a whole table set up with warm goods and a kitchen that's constantly going. There's about 12 patrons in there right now in the process of eating or ordering. It's called the Meal Hearth. 
 TRAVIS: Your hands are going to be all sticky before you handle the books.
 LIAM: Better than after.
 (groaning and laughter)
 MATT: If you'd like to, you can load up on--
 LIAM: Yeah, what are you in the mood for? Do you want something sweet or something savory? 
 LAURA: Oh man, this bakery that we had in Nicodranas had amazing bear claws. 
 LIAM: Bear claws. Well let's see. Excuse me? Whoever's running this show.
 MATT: In the midst of the chaos you see a young man in his late teens or so with a little bit of a prickly chinstrap beard, very short, tattered brown hair but other than that spry, smiling. He has an apron on, and he's currently putting a small tray on the edge, "Hello. Can I help you?" 
 LIAM: Yeah, we're in the mood for some bear claws, the kind they have in Nicodranas. Have you heard of these? Do you have them? 
 MATT: "We have bear claws. I don't know if we have any Nicodranas bear claws?"
 LIAM: We'll take the bear claws, yeah?
 LAURA: Yes, and then we can compare and let you know.
 MATT: "As far as I know the only major difference is they load it up with cinnamon--"
 LAURA: That's exactly what I was going to say! Cinnamon, yes!
 MATT: "We can do that. That'll be done. How many would you like?"
 LIAM: Probably ten bear claws. Also do you have any hot freshly baked bread?
 MATT: "That we do as well. Of course."
 LIAM: I will take a large loaf of hot bread, fresh out of the oven, please. 
 MATT: "Yeah, you'll have to wait the moment. About 20, 25 minutes, we'll have a fresh one for you."
 MARISHA: Maybe we can go shopping and come back? 
 LIAM: Yeah, we'll return. We'll double back for the bear claws. So we'll come back for ten of these and that hot bread.
 MATT: "So ten bear claws and bread. You want to pay in advance?"
 LIAM: Yeah, sure, that's no problem. What do I need?
 MATT: So for all the bear claws and the loaf of bread--
 LAURA: I don't know.
 MATT: Yeah, it's not that much.
 LIAM: $13.50? 
 MATT: Probably run you three silver.
 LIAM: Okay. One. Two. Three. Easy. Thank you very much.
 MATT: Of course. See you back here in a minute. As soon as you turn around, somebody else has pushed past you and gotten in the front. "I'd like three of--" and you're like, ugh, this place is awful.
 LIAM: Come on, it's too crowded in there.
 LAURA: Caleb, I'll buy you some porn.
 LIAM: Okay, that's good to know. I lead the way to Chastity's Nook.
 MATT: As you enter the small shop, the interior is beautiful and surprisingly busy. There's five other patrons that are currently perusing through various tomes and stacks of artwork. You can see it carries many books and different types of tawdry decor, like rugs, embroidered tapestries, candles, both scented and not, and you can smell oils and incense in there as well. It's this mishmash of scents. It's dark-lit in the interior, but as soon as you enter, almost every other person glances over their shoulder at you and goes back about their business. As soon as you finish scanning the room, a voice peeks up and goes, "Hello!" You glance over and see a human female in her 40s, mousey brown hair, wild and curly that goes past her shoulders, and she has a heavy sweater on and these big glasses right in front of her face. She goes, "Can I help you?"
 LIAM: That is a very handsome sweater you have. Is that from here in the city?
 MATT: "Thank you so much. It was a gift."
 LIAM: I'm sorry, what is your name?
 MATT: "Iva."
 LIAM: Iva. Pleasure to meet you.
 MATT: "Iva Deshin and this is my shop."
 LIAM: Iva Deshin. I'm new to town, and I'm looking for a bit of reading, and this place has been highly recommended to me, and I'm wondering what--
 MATT: A grin curls past her face. She goes, "Recommended? You want to go to that back." She points, and you can see now that she's pointed out, because it's one long chamber with shelves and a central table. The beginning has more of the accouterments, like the candles and the various knickknacks you can purchase. In the back, you can already see there are large scrolls that are hung up, with beautifully painted nudes. You can see rows and rows of--
 LIAM: I made you plan for this!
 MATT: I know you did. Yeah, you did, buddy. There are stacks of books where the covers have their own individual paintings, where you can see--
 TRAVIS: Yep. Detail!
 MATT: You can see a portion of a moonlight painting of a brawny-looking man who's dipping a fainting woman in a delicate dress, glistening across the moonlight. It's slightly pulled open, yeah. This is the young adult romance section of any bookstore on full display, and the more you look back, you can see there's a few figures in the process of thumbing through the books, reading them where they stand in the middle there. "Are you looking for anything in particular?"
 LIAM: You know, my tastes are very varied. I'm always looking for something new.
 MATT: "Ooh, I have recommendations, if you like."
 LIAM: Of course. I am very interested in literature recommendations.
 MATT: "There's Zemnian Nights. Very popular. There's The Enchanting Tryst, for those who want more of a fantastical perspective. Scent of the Sea, for the traveler who enjoys their perusal. That one is outer empire, so folks have varying interest. There's Tusk Love. That one's a little more saucy."
 ALL: Tusk Love!
 (laughter)
 MATT: "If you want something more gentle, something that's more of a classic love story, we have Guard of My Heart. Shallow Breaths are a bit more bawdy."
 LAURA: I want to buy Tusk Love, please.
 MATT: "Right this way."
 LIAM: As she walks away from us: You know, I'm obviously here for a purpose, but I like historical fiction as well, and I like when the two things are combined. Do you know what I mean?
 LAURA: Sex and history.
 MATT: She leans in for a moment and gives you a look. "Follow me." She leads you both to the back. She plucks a copy of Tusk Love.
 SAM: There's a guy in an Abraham Lincoln costume, just whacking it.
 (laughter)
 MARISHA: I'm following, by the way.
 TRAVIS: Four score--
 MATT: "Define 'historical.' What are your interests?"
 LIAM: I like historical fiction. I don't like shallow smut. I like to learn something while I'm being titillated, I suppose.
 MATT: Make a persuasion check. 
 TRAVIS: My shirt's gone back up.
 MARISHA: Oh my god.
 MATT: You made me do this, Liam.
 LAURA: I love how many book titles you have. 
 TRAVIS and MARISHA: Edubation.
 MATT: Edubation?!
 TRAVIS: A squared plus B squared equals C squared.
 LIAM: I have rolled a *zwanzig,* that is twenty.
 MATT: Okay. "It's been banned for the past 15 years, but I do have a couple of reclaimed copies of Courting of the Crick, if you'd be interested."
 SAM: Courting of the Crick.
 LIAM: I'm very much interested, in this and other books as well, but we will start with (whispers) the Courting of the Crick.
 MATT: "Well, because it's--" and the voice stays very hushed, and she adjusts her glasses, the closer she gets "--because it is technically not supposed to be here, it's a bit pricier. That one runs you about 15 gold pieces."
 LIAM: I'm still interested. I would like to see the quality of the book. You know, see if it's in mint condition.
 MATT: "Of course, it's not a worry. Just a moment." The other books, the regular books--
 LIAM: Did she walk away from me, by the way?
 MATT: Briefly, yeah.
 LIAM: I cast Detect Magic.
 MATT: Okay.
 LAURA: On her? On the room?
 LIAM: Everything.
 MATT: As you complete your incantation, there is a slight shimmer of energy that expands around the chamber, and scanning through and across the books, nothing peeks out at you as magical from the shelves. It looks there's only a collection of tomes. You get a small blip from the hunched, cloaked figure in the corner that's currently reading through one of the books hurriedly. Just a faint source of magic on their person.
 LIAM: The range, I believe, is 30 feet, if I'm not mistaken. Yeah, it is. Am I covering every part of the store where I am? I start to browse. If anything looks out of reach of the spell that I have just cast, I will walk in that direction.
 MATT: Right. It's concentration, so you can pass around. You scan the entirety of the room. It does not appear to be that there is anything directly magical being put on any of the shelves.
 MARISHA: It's because this whole place is magical, Caleb.
 TRAVIS: Angels and demons.
 MATT: The only blip of magic source you're getting is from one of the patrons.
 LIAM: Just one of the patrons. Nothing behind any doors, nothing on the shelves. Okay, I wait for her to return.
 MARISHA: Does there appear to be a used book section, like trade-ins?
 MATT: Unfortunately, no. There isn't a lot of business for used books here in the Tri-Spires. Most folks purchase and display on their shelves. It's a symbol of status. The more books you have, the more you can display on your shelves, the more well-read you are to your guests, as you have them over. There isn't a big market for returning things you've read.
 MARISHA: Huh. Okay. You can learn a lot from what people wrote in books.
 LAURA: I walk up to one of the other patrons that's hurriedly looking through one of the books.
 MATT: Okay. The one that's closest to you, or one of the other ones?
 LAURA: Sure. Whatever one is closest to me.
 MATT: The one that's closest to you, as you approach from behind, he has a dark brown cloak that's pulled over one shoulder. He's wearing a sky blue tunic, soft, a silk sheen to it in what little bit of lantern light is lighting the interior. From the side of his chin, you can see he's got a softer, rounder face, and as soon as you begin to approach, as you aren't approaching quietly, he stops, the book closes, back on the shelf. Make a perception check.
 LAURA: Oh no. Perception? 18.
 MATT: It is Shallow Breaths.
 TRAVIS: Breasts, or breaths?
 MATT: Breaths.
 TALIESIN: Heaving.
 TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Heaving breasts.
 TRAVIS: (breathes deeply)
 LAURA: Ooh, Shallow Breaths, that's a good one.
 MATT: As the guy turns around, you can see him. He's mid to late thirties, you would expect, dark hair slicked back, the hairline pulling back a bit, male pattern baldness-style, human, and as soon he whips around: "Oh, I'm just perusing."
 LAURA: It's not one of your favorites?
 MATT: "I don't know, I've not read it, I couldn't tell you."
 LAURA: What's your name?
 MATT: "I need to go." He pushes past you, and as he begins to exit the chamber, he goes, "I'm all right, I'm good, thank you this time, good bye," and darts out into the rain.
 LAURA: I open it up and see what Shallow Breaths is about.
 MATT: It is smutty. We're talking like, Anne Rice fairy tale book-level.
 TALIESIN: Good skirt around there, by the way. Well done. We were all in high school once, it's okay.
 MATT: No, I got really into Interview with a Vampire, and then my mom got these great new Anne Rice books, and I was like, "Oh, she made new books about Cinderella, that's-- oh." Yeah. It's what you'd expect.
 LAURA: Smutty.
 MARISHA: Hey, Jester. Do you think that the fact that this place is called, "Chastity's Nook" gives everyone a complex who shops here?
 LAURA: Yes.
 MARISHA: Yeah.
 LAURA: It's really good.
 MATT: At this point, Iva returns with a book-sized tome that is covered in a soft deerskin leather, pulls it open, and shows you the outside of it. It's very high quality, like it's barely been read. "This is the piece."
 LIAM: That is finely made. May I hold it?
 MATT: "You may." She looks over to make sure they're blocking the view to anybody else.
 LIAM: I turn with her, so that my back is, and I speed read four pages.
 LAURA: Are there illustrations?
 LIAM: Oh jeez!
 MATT: Interestingly enough, it begins almost like The Silmarillion, in the sense that it reads not very flowery.
 TRAVIS: In a hole in the ground.
 MATT: It has a very instructional, nonfiction, historical-type speech. It begins to talk of early empirical conflicts. It begins to talk of the post-Calamity. It begins to hint at the ideas of forbidden romance between sides that were not meant to meet. A lot of it begins like, "and then this person led this army into this place, and these many were slaughtered."
 LIAM: Out of curiosity, if I flip through, do I see any boning anywhere inside?
 MATT: As you begin to flip through, she (chuckles), "I understand if that was enough of a peek and you're interested, you could purchase?"
 LIAM: Yes, it's a high quality item, you can understand my excitement. I've been thinking in the space of time that you have left, and while I would like to purchase something here today, I'm very low on funds, and the nature of this book, and the trouble I could get into-- I mean, your secret is safe with me, but it is too hot for my hands. I was wondering if you had a copy of Shallow Breaths here?
 MATT: "That I do. And not a worry." She quickly folds it up and tucks it under her arm and hides it amongst her sweater. Right over here. She picks up a copy, the same copy the gentleman was looking through earlier, and hands it to you.
 LIAM: Perfect. How much would this run me?
 MATT: "Three silver pieces."
 LIAM: Three silver, okay. I take out the three silver. One, two, three, and I hand it over.
 MATT: "Thank you very much."
 LIAM: Yes, and did you two want to get anything?
 LAURA: Yes, I want to buy the Tusky Love one.
 MATT: "That is also three silver pieces."
 LAURA: (whispers) And I want to buy the other one that's expensive, please, thank you. Yeah.
 MATT: (whispers) "All right, that's 15 gold."
 LAURA: But be secret when you put it in my bag, okay?
 MATT: Okay.
 SAM: Paper bag.
 (laughter)
 MATT: Very terrible discreet hand-off, where it's like-- She adjusts her glasses once more. "Thank you, and it's been a pleasure. If you're ever interested, I do my own writing, and am in the process of finishing the third chapter of my next series, so--"
 MARISHA: I would love to see it right now.
 MATT: "Well, it's not done."
 MARISHA: Do you have a sample?
 LIAM: What is your niche?
 MATT: “Well,” She gets a little nervous, reaches behind, pulls out a small piece of paper, and says, “I need this back because it’s part of my manuscript. You can have a glance over it.”
 TRAVIS: Tumblr is so happy right now.
 MARISHA: What is it?
 MATT: At a quick glance, it is not very well written. It’s a bit ham-fisted in its analogies and descriptives. You have caught the middle of a saucy meeting of a strong, strapping farmhand, who is currently trying to work down the cost of a piece of equipment by the purveyor. You don't have enough information to make out the full story, but it’s this, “How can I get this at a cheaper price?”
 MARISHA: She’s very heavy-handed with her innuendos.
 MATT: The salesman’s like, “Well, I don’t know. How much are you willing to pay?” It goes back and forth, and you’re like, I see where this is going, but it’s not going there fast enough.
 MARISHA: They keep talking about the heft of his equipment. A *lot* of reference to his equipment.
 TRAVIS: The gauge of his pipe?
 MARISHA: Yeah, it’s-- Do you--?
 MATT: “Do you like it?”
 MARISHA: Oh, do I.
 MATT: Make a deception check.
 MARISHA: Fuck! I was thinking of Fjord as I was trying to be nice!
 TRAVIS: Yeah, you were doing it.
 LIAM: All her hopes and dreams.
 MARISHA: It’s cocked, right? Okay, thank you. 18.
 MATT: She’s like, “Oh good! I’m so glad you like it.”
 MARISHA: You know, there seems to be a lot of machinery knowledge and, like, heavy machinery knowledge. Was that also an interest of yours?
 MATT: “Oh, well there was a family background, yes. Before I took up writing.”
 MARISHA: Man, I’ve never seen engineering and-- combined!
 MATT: “I think it’s rare that I meet people that are interested in seeing that type of niche. Thank you. I hope to have it ready for sale, hopefully within the next three or four months, so please do come by again.”
 MARISHA: Consider me interested.
 MATT: “Thank you.”
 TRAVIS: Is there a mailing list?
 MARISHA: Yeah, I almost asked if there was. Is there a mailing list? You got to get the word out. Get people interested.
 MATT: “It’s kind of a word of mouth thing. The clientele prefer a bit of privacy.”
 MARISHA: Sure!
 LAURA: While this was going on, and she was distracted. 
 MATT: Oh no.
 LAURA: Can I find one of the books that looks easily accessible? I want to open it up and on the inside write: We’re watching you. We saw you come in here.
 MATT: You grab a quick copy of Guard of My Heart. The cover has the actual Crownsguard crest printed on it. It is a dynamic of honor versus what the heart wants. Make a sleight of hand check.
 LIAM: Written by Seven Corbo.
 LAURA: That’s so good! Plus five, so what is that? 23? 23.
 MATT: As you quickly whip through the statement, close the book, set it on the shelf, no one any the wiser. You have a sense of accomplishment wash over you. You hear this faint, distant chuckle that is sourceless, but pleased.
 LAURA: That felt good.
 MATT: You have your smut. What would you like to do now?
 LIAM: It’s probably about time to go pick up the bear claws.
 LAURA: The pastries!
 MATT: Easily enough. It’s still raining, but not quite the heavy drizzle it was earlier. It’s lighting up a little bit. As soon as you step outside, you can see, way far off in the distance, a little bit of blue begin to break. The heavy part of the stormfront, at least, is beginning to pass. You pick up the remainder of your ordered baked goods and a loaf of bread as well.
 LIAM: On the top shelf, behind you there. What do you call those? These pastries? I slide the smut under a tray of bread.
 MATT: You slide it under a what?
 LIAM: A tray of bread on the counter.
 MATT: Just on the counter?
 LIAM: Yeah. Hide it.
 MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.
 LIAM: They look the other way.
 SAM: You learn from the best.
 LIAM: That’s all right. 11.
 MATT: 11, okay. He glances up, “Oh, that’s more bread.”
 LIAM: Oh. Okay. I’ll take my bread, please.
 MATT: “Yes, of course. Fresh. Here you are, sir!”
 LIAM: Thank you. Would you like to carry the bear claws?
 LAURA: Yes please! Thank you.
 LIAM: As we’re walking out, I will show you a trick that I’ve learned in the past few years. It’s very cold out. I pull sides of the bread out. It’s hot. I hand to you a bread, and I hand you a piece of bread, and then I shove my hands in. It’s warm, and I can eat it later! Let’s go.
 MARISHA: Oh, Caleb.
 LAURA: You know you can buy mittens?
 MARISHA: Yeah, there are muffs? Like hand muffs?
 LIAM: Yeah, but I can eat this. Why are you looking at me that way?
 LAURA: It’s weird, Caleb.
 LIAM: It’s not weird. Many people have done this in this make-believe world and also in America. I walk out the door.
 LAURA: Well, it’s really good bread.
 MATT: Any other business you’d like to tend to while you’re in the Tri-Spire, or are you joining your friends?
 LAURA: I think there’s a casino here. 
 SAM: Jesus!
 LAURA: But, we can just go to the Pillow Trove.
 SAM: (loud whispering) Do you want to drop off that key first?
 LAURA: That’s why I’m going to the Pillow Trove!
 SAM: Oh okay. Yeah.
 LAURA: I heard Nott telling me something.
 SAM: I am the Traveler.
 TALIESIN: I thought were going to go for Mighty Nein sponsorship at the Nook.
 MARISHA: As we walk along to the Pillow Trove, when we walk by the flowery bushes, I slowly pop all the blossoms off the flowers as I go.
 MATT: As you guys make your way to the interior of the Pillow Trove, the same woman clerk, who you met the other day, is there in the process of going through and organizing the last bit of information of the few folks that got rooms the night before. You see at the top of the split staircase a female elf: brunette with golden eyes, older in the face. You see some lines along the cheeks that-- for elves, that age gracefully-- shows a bit of age. You see a very beautiful, laced, red dress that goes up to the neck, with a bit of a window right there. The arms are crossed and folded in front, and as you enter, looks down and smiles. The clerk glances up, “Oh, hello again.”
 LAURA: She’s beautiful. Who’s that?
 MATT: “That’s Madam Luenna. Madame?” and the woman descends the stairs, one step at a time, arms crossed. “Hello. Pleasure to make your acquaintance.”
 LAURA: You too.
 MATT: “Can I help you?”
 LAURA: I don’t know. I just asked who you were because you’re really pretty.
 MATT: “I am the owner of the Pillow Trove.”
 LAURA: Oh! It’s beautiful! You did a really good job in here decorating.
 MATT: “Thank you so much. I greatly appreciate it.”
 LAURA: Your dress is really pretty, too.
 MATT: “Thank you kindly. So?”
 LAURA: I came to get all my stuff out of my room and then I’m going to give the key back, okay?
 MATT: “You’re checking out? How unfortunate.”
 LAURA: I am, but I’ll be back very soon because I have a package coming. So be on the lookout for one to Jester.
 MATT: “Jester. Is that your name?”
 LAURA: That is me.
 MATT: She takes your hand and holds it. “A pleasure, my dear. Good bye.”
 LAURA: Good bye.
 MATT: Turns and makes her way back up the stairs.
 LAURA and MARISHA: She’s really pretty. 
 LAURA: Did you see her eyes? They were golden.
 MARISHA: Yeah.
 LAURA: You want to see my room?
 MARISHA: Sure!
 TRAVIS: Want to see my toys?
 MATT: You walk upstairs, you find the room. It’s small, the one that you had rented, but it’s beautiful in the interior. The sheets have layered lace. High thread count. It’s quite awesome. There is a balcony, though the curtain’s currently drawn because of the rainy day outside. It’s a very nice room.
 LIAM: I slide my hand under the sheets, and I feel that thread count.
 MARISHA: Your hands are dirty! You’re covered in bread!
 LAURA: No! It’s okay because I rented it! I pull the covers off.
 MARISHA: Oh, that’s right!
 LAURA: Lay down! You want to lay down! You can use it!
 LIAM: Maybe if you had carried a ruler, you could hit my knuckles harder next time.
 MARISHA: Would you like that? 
 LIAM: No.
 MARISHA: Would you like some mitts?
 LIAM: No!
 MARISHA: You know this is how diseases are spread, right?
 LIAM: I light my hand on fire.
 LAURA: Why didn’t you just light your hands on fire instead of putting it in bread?
 LIAM: I would’ve burned the bread and then I couldn’t eat it. It’s simple.
 LAURA: It’s toast. It’s actually really tasty.
 LIAM: Well, I don’t have-- the control is a little tricky sometimes.
 LAURA: Little off.
 LIAM: Sometimes.
 LAURA: Open the curtains up!
 MARISHA: Did we get a good view?
 MATT: You get a decent view. It’s not terribly high up, but you get to look down over the street below you, the cobblestones still slick and the rain pattering on the stonework. You see the fences that curl around the exterior of the terrace. The treetops are now more visible and the canopy is puffing up behind the larger estates and buildings that make up the interior of the Tri-Spires. You have a pretty decent view of the Zauber Spire from here. You see it domes towards the very peak. There is a glass, cylindrical, top floor that overlooks the entirety of the city. Make a perception check.
 MARISHA: Okay. Natural 19. Plus three so 22.
 MATT: Not too difficult for you to see, even through the bit of rain that's up there, but at the very top where you see the glass exterior, you see the outline of two figures that are standing, looking over the entire city from up there.
 MARISHA: At the top of the Zauber Spire?
 MATT: Yeah, Zauber Spire.
 LIAM: Zauber. Like sour.
 MARISHA: What do they look like? Are they wearing any colors?
 MATT: You can't make out the full details of them from this distance, but you can see the basic shape and outline of two figures looking out.
 LAURA: I'm dancing around the room while you're looking.
 MATT: Jester's just darting around.
 LAURA: Literally dancing around.
 LIAM: What are you looking at? You're squinting.
 MARISHA: Just looking. Just, you know, people watching.
 LIAM: Where are there people?
 MARISHA: These two assholes up there on the top of the Zauber Spire.
 LIAM, MARISHA, and LAURA: Zauber.
 LAURA: I crawl under the bed.
 MARISHA: Hey, the whole Cerberus Assembly thing. Do you know much about them?
 LIAM: I mean, if you are in the empire you've heard of the Cerberus Assembly, *ja*.
 MARISHA: Yeah, no. I know. We're both empire kids, right? More so than the rest of the Nein? What do you think about the empire? About the crown?
 LIAM: It is what it is.
 MARISHA: Okay. I think it's kind of bullshitty.
 LIAM: Well, that is also true, but it also is what it is. It's the empire.
 LAURA: What makes it bullshitty?
 MATT: You hear Jester say from underneath the bed.
 LIAM: Where are you? What are you doing down there?
 LAURA: I was seeing if anybody left anything good under here. 
 LIAM: And?
 LAURA: Did anybody leave anything good under the bed?
 MATT: No. Actually, it's pretty well-cleaned and maintained underneath there.
 LAURA: It's pretty well-cleaned though, so nothing is here that's good. Not even any bugs or anything.
 MARISHA: I don't know, look at this. Look at how much money is up here compared to elsewhere. This is a lot of control.
 LIAM: Yeah. What are you going to do about it?
 MARISHA: (laughs) (sighs)
 LAURA: Are you going to do something, Beau? I stick my head out. Are you planning a rebellion?
 MARISHA: No. I just want to make a ton of money and drink a lot of booze.
 LAURA: Okay!
 LIAM: Insight check. One.
 (laughter)
 LIAM: Thanks, Pike.
 LAURA: I believe you.
 LIAM: We're going to hit the bars tonight.
 MARISHA: I think best we can do is try and be happy in, as you said, this shitty situation that we've all been granted.
 LIAM: Nationwide, yeah.
 MARISHA: Yeah. Anyway, should we go?
 LIAM: Should we go or--?
 LAURA: Oh, sure. I crawl out from under the bed. Caleb? I got you a present.
 LIAM: Did you? You bought that book?
 LAURA: I bought you history porn!
 LIAM: You bought me that book? That is so expensive for this book. This is just smut.
 LAURA: Well, technically, you gave me the money for it. Is it useful?
 LIAM: I don't know. I don't read things like this.
 MARISHA: Mind if I take a look at it?
 LIAM: Yeah, you have it.
 MARISHA: I'm going to flip through it. Does anything catch my eye based on what I know?
 MATT: I mean, do you want to sit and read it, like full? If you skim through it, you see pages, like some of it smutty, some of it seems boring.
 LIAM: You know, the thing is, places like that are like yard sales. 99% of the time, there is nothing but broken crap. But once, and I pat the book in one of my holsters, I found something.
 LAURA: Is that the one I drew the dick in?
 LIAM: Did you draw the dick on the Friends spell? You did it? That's the one.
 LAURA: Yes!
 LIAM: Yeah I found that in a porn shop.
 LAURA: Really? Are there pawn shops here?
 LIAM: Porn.
 LAURA: A porn shop?
 LIAM: Yeah. Hidden.
 MARISHA: You know, this reminds me of the stuff that I used to read back in school.
 LAURA: You read porn in school?
 MARISHA: No, like all the history stuff. It feels like a bored monk wrote this. A real bored monk.
 MATT: If you want to take the time to read it, either now or another time, I can give you more information, but scanning through, you don't see anything that catches your eye.
 MARISHA: I might read it later when you're done reading it.
 LIAM: You go first. Give me your review.
 MARISHA: Really?
 LIAM: Yeah. Have at it.
 LAURA: Caleb doesn't want it.
 MARISHA: It's a great gift. Honestly, I was thinking about buying it and then you beat me to it. Great minds, right?
 LAURA: There you go. It was a present for you all along. Well, I wish I would have known. I would have bought you that other shitty book you bought.
 LIAM: I appreciate the gesture, because it is the thought that counts. It's the gesture, Jester.
 LAURA: That's my name.
 LIAM: But seriously, thank you.
 LAURA: You're welcome.
 MARISHA: What's this book called? Does it have a name?
 LIAM: A Tale of Two Titties.
 MATT: No. Courting of the Crick.
 LAURA, MATT, and MARISHA: Courting of the Crick.
 TRAVIS: Good luck adding that shit.
 MARISHA: I know. Yeah, I'm not going to be able to type that in. I'll write that down.
 MATT: You've bought baked goods, you've bought smut, and you've played in a hotel room. What do you guys want to do now?
 LAURA: I guess we can go back then.
 LIAM: There's a casino. You want to go to the casino? I don't want to go there.
 LAURA: Are there any religious temples here?
 MATT: You'd have to ask around. Make an investigation check.
 LAURA: That's shit. Six.
 MATT: You have a hard time finding somebody who can give you any information. Most folks, a couple of individuals you stop go like, "Oh I don't know about religion (scoffs)," and walk away. There is less of an interest in conversing with you.
 MARISHA: You see why I left this town? Ugh, people.
 MATT: No luck on that, unfortunately.
 LAURA: What about in the Pillow Trove? Do they have a little library there?
 MATT: They do not. It seems that they're not providing anything simply to read. You'd probably have to bring in your own or purchase them from the local Chastity's Nook.
 LAURA: Okay.
 LIAM: This neighborhood makes me a little edgy to be honest. I'm done. But I will go with you if you want to go somewhere.
 LAURA: No, I think I'm good.
 LIAM: Shall we go?
 MARISHA: Good when you all are good.
 LAURA: (singing) Let's go back to the stinky part of town.
 MARISHA: (singing) Okay.
 MATT: You guys meet up back at The Leaky Tap with the rest of your party. You have already retrieved your freshly transposed enchantment on your breastplate. You guys gather once again in the tavern to consolidate your plans for the day.
 TRAVIS: Can I pull Molly aside? Hey, I wanted to ask you. When you stopped Nott from rifling through my shit last night, what was she looking for?
 TALIESIN: I didn't think to ask. Honestly.
 TRAVIS: She wasn't grabbing for anything in particular?
 TALIESIN: Not that I remember.
 TRAVIS: She going through your stuff too or just mine?
 TALIESIN: Oh god, no, not my stuff. That'd be ridiculous. My stuff's worthless.
 TRAVIS: Just can't help herself, I guess.
 TALIESIN: Well, you know. Some people have needs. It happens. Just keep an eye on your things and make sure you always know how much money is in your purse.
 TRAVIS: Fair enough.
 MATT: At this point, it's early afternoon. Is there anything you wish to do with your day? Any place you wish to go? Anybody you wish to talk to? What do you want to do?
 LIAM: You know, I'm a little tuckered. I'm going to take a rest upstairs. I'm going to copy that last spell into my book. I'll see you guys in a little bit, maybe around dinner time.
 MATT: Do you guys hang around until he's ready?
 LAURA: I guess I can go check out one of the temples.
 TRAVIS: I'm going to wander around the back side of The Leaky Tap.
 MARISHA: Before you leave, real quick, Beau asks you if you found any information out while you were on your journey.
 TRAVIS: I didn't. Actually, I happened to ask Pumat Sols, the plural, and he happens to be like an annex shop of the Cerberus Assembly.
 MARISHA: Really? I'm with it.
 TRAVIS: So he supplies goods to all parts of the kingdom, but he says they keep a good balance in check from the power of the empire. Keeps a tight leash. I didn't ask about any religious uprising or anything, but he seems like such a nice guy and doesn't seem the type to rat.
 MARISHA: Right. Interesting. We went to the fancy end of town where I'm pretty sure everyone is super into the crown because they are all funded by the crown and they are the crown, so I was like eh, probably a bad place to start asking political questions.
 TRAVIS: Nobody stopped you? You got in all right?
 MARISHA: We did, yeah! Went to a smut shop.
 TRAVIS: Oh good. How'd that go?
 MARISHA: As to be expected. Smutty. What should we do?
 TRAVIS: Well I was just thinking, for this evening, maybe we should double-check there aren't alternate exits coming in and out of that cellar.
 MARISHA: Yeah, in case it's a trap or something.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, that dwarf didn't really give me a very good feeling.
 MARISHA: Also, we know that people are looking for these type of rebels. If we can see a board ratting people out, so can other people. We don't want to get caught in a sting operation, for lack of a better term.
 TRAVIS: Right. You want to walk around the back to see if there's another way in?
 MARISHA: Yeah.
 TRAVIS: Can we go around the back of the tavern and look for back doors, floor latches?
 MATT: Sure. Do you guys want to make separate investigation checks or does one of you want to help the other?
 TRAVIS: I'll help you make it.
 MATT: So you get advantage on your investigation check.
 MARISHA: Big money! Are you fucking serious?
 TRAVIS: Which ones did you roll?
 MARISHA: Wait, they're both threes. I rolled two threes. Both threes.
 TRAVIS: With the plus.
 MARISHA: Four, so seven.
 MATT: You spend a while looking around the back of the tavern. There is a back entrance that leads into the kitchen. There is a cellar entrance. You're not sure if it goes to the same place where you met or a separate subterranean space, but it is currently locked off, chained.
 TRAVIS: Locked off, chained? Does this alley have a lot of human traffic or are we on our own?
 MATT: No, you guys are on your own at the moment.
 MARISHA: Can you try and pick this?
 TRAVIS: I mean, I have a crowbar.
 MARISHA: Oh my god. I'm going to stand watch in the opening of the alley. I'm going to make sure while he does this.
 TRAVIS: Yeah. I have a crowbar.
 MATT: So you're going to go ahead and pry the chain off of it?
 TRAVIS: Can I try and pop the lock? Is it like a chain and a lock?
 MATT: Yeah it's a chain and a lock.
 TRAVIS: Oh shit. That's not as good.
 MARISHA: We could get Nott in here to try and pick it. Just leave it nicely looked like it's not opened.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, that's true. That is what she does. You want to go snag her? I'll keep an eye.
 MARISHA: Yeah. I'll be right back. Nott!
 SAM: (gnawing) What?
 MARISHA: I hate to interrupt your dinner. Can we borrow you for a quick second?
 SAM: (swallowing) Mm-hmm.
 MATT: You get led outside in the soft drizzled exterior into the alleyway, feet clomping through the muddy floor. They show you to the outside of an angled door that leads to a basement cellar that is currently chained with a lock in the center of it.
 MARISHA: Can you pick this?
 SAM: Can I pick that lock?
 MARISHA: Yeah.
 SAM: Keep a lookout.
 TRAVIS: I do a quick look. Both ends of the alleys and on the windows around the area.
 MARISHA: Yeah. He takes one end; I take the other.
 MATT: Perception check from each of you guys and make a check with your thieves' tools.
 MARISHA: Jesus fucking ballsacks.
 SAM: (tink)
 TRAVIS: Mine's okay. 16.
 MARISHA: Seven again.
 SAM: One. It's magically enchanted. It's magically-- Ah! My eyes! Ah! It's magically enchanted!
 TRAVIS: Shh! I cover her mouth.
 SAM: Are my thieves' tools broken?
 MATT: Pretty bent.
 MARISHA: Oh that sucks. Oh I have thieves' tools! Can I try?
 SAM: Give them to me!
 MARISHA: I give Nott my thieves' tools.
 MATT: Which is good, because your thieves' tools, currently, are not very good. You're down one set. You can try again. You don't see anybody currently heading down or near the alley at the moment.
 TRAVIS: No windows?
 MATT: No. There aren't any windows in the back of the building, since there are small vents for kitchen smoke to filter out, but there's no windows looking out into the alley.
 TRAVIS: No windows facing that way.
 SAM: Better. What do I add?
 MATT: You add your proficiency bonus and your dexterity.
 SAM: 21.
 MATT: 21.
 SAM: These tools are so much better than mine.
 MARISHA: Yeah, I stole them off of a really rich guy.
 MATT: The lock comes straight off.
 SAM: Can I hang on to them for--
 MARISHA: Yeah.
 SAM: You can have mine. Actually you can't, I'd like to keep them.
 MARISHA: You'll just owe me later, how about that?
 SAM: Sure.
 MATT: Pull the lock of the changes, open the cellar and look down. It's dark. There's no light source in there.
 TRAVIS: I have my orc--
 MARISHA: I put on the goggles.
 TRAVIS: Go for it, yeah. Might as well use that.
 MATT: You head down. It is a second cellar. It is not the same cellar you guys have met with before.
 MARISHA: It's not the same cellar.
 MATT: No, this one can only be reached from the exterior.
 MARISHA: There's no entrances? No secret entrances? No trap doors hiding behind barrels?
 MATT: Make an investigation check.
 MARISHA: Don't fuck this up this time, come on.
 MATT: You have--
 TRAVIS: That's cocked.
 MATT: You have disadvantage on this because there is no light source.
 MARISHA: It's cocked on a 20.
 LIAM: Yeah, it's cocked.
 SAM: He said disadvantage.
 MARISHA: What?
 MATT: Because there's no light in there. So even though you have darkvision, it's still dim light.
 MARISHA: Well. Okay. What am I doing? Investigation? 11.
 MATT: You don't see any other passageways. No hidden doors or anything. In fact, this one's fairly empty. There's a few barrels in here and some small crates, but a lot has been moved out of here, either because it was recently used or it hasn't been restocked.
 MARISHA: Any good bottles of wine or brews laying around?
 SAM: Yeah, I'm going to search around for valuable shit.
 MATT: Go for it. You find, not a bottle of wine, but you find a couple of heavy jugs of some sort of an older ale.
 SAM: 23.
 MATT: 23? Okay, you glance around, you find a few odd copper pieces that are in the dust. You do find a set of metal bracelets.
 SAM: Connected to each other?
 MATT: No. They're separate. But you do see they're currently resting around a skeletal wrist.
 MARISHA: There's a skeleton down here?
 SAM: Is it a human size skeleton?
 MATT: It is a human size skeleton. It's been here for a long time.
 SAM: (stuttering) Dead guy.
 MARISHA: Did they not clean when they bought this place?
 SAM: This was some sort of a dungeon.
 TRAVIS: I come down at the mention of a skeletal wrist. Are there any other bodies in this cellar?
 MARISHA: Yeah.
 MATT: That's the only one you find.
 MARISHA: Hang on, no one's around, right? 
 MATT: Not at the moment, no.
 MARISHA: I'm going to pull out my adventurer's kit and light a torch, because fuck this darkvision shit.
 MATT: So you get a torch situated. It lights up, the room's brighter.
 MARISHA: No one knows we're down here, right? The door's closed.
 MATT: Not at the moment, no.
 TRAVIS: Well, I'm going to leave because we're all three down here and go back up to the top and keep an eye.
 MATT: Okay.
 MARISHA: Okay. Do we see anything else weird? More dead bodies, anything like that?
 MATT: No more dead bodies. Even this one you find is mostly like it was stuffed behind some of the barrels.
 SAM: Can I tell how it died?
 MATT: You can make a medicine check.
 SAM: Not good. Five.
 MATT: No idea.
 SAM: Died of a broken heart.
 MATT: It's just a skeleton.
 SAM: No clothes?
 MATT: There is some elements of cloth on there but it's been down here long enough to decompose to a mostly skeletal state. So it was probably here a long time ago, and it was pressed up into this corner and barrels were pushed up against it to keep it out of sight. Probably the reason it hasn't been found until now. 
 SAM: Okay. Nothing to see.
 MARISHA: That's really gross. 
 TRAVIS: No other ways in or out, huh?
 MARISHA: Yeah, anything else now that I have the light on? I don't see anything?
 MATT: No.
 MARISHA: Shit. (long sigh) I take one of those bottles of beer, then I leave.
 MATT: Okay. It's somewhat cloudy when you shake it, but still full.
 TRAVIS: Close the door up, run the chain back through, put the lock on it, but don't lock it. Well. We're going to have to have a good, I don't know, a good chain of eyes out as we're down there tonight.
 SAM: Do you want to establish some sort of, like, if you get in trouble is there a way to alert us?
 MARISHA: Frumpkin? I don't know.
 TRAVIS: Not really, because if Caleb's going to be down there with us-- I think, if we start screaming or you hear a ruckus--
 SAM: If I'm with you, I can cast Message and alert our friends.
 TRAVIS: See, down there I'm not so worried.
 MARISHA and TRAVIS: It's about people coming in.
 SAM: Oh, well then I'll stay out and I'll Message you when--
 MARISHA: Let's do that.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, somebody outside The Leaky Tap, another person on the inside to run interference, because you can buy us a couple seconds.
 MARISHA: You can Message Caleb.
 SAM: I can Message any of you.
 MARISHA: Or any of us.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, couple layers, right?
 MARISHA: Okay. Any other prep we should do?
 TRAVIS: Nah.
 MARISHA: Okay, let's do this.
 MATT: We still have a few hours until sundown. Do you guys want to wait until the evening comes about? You can.
 MARISHA: Get food. I'll read some of my book.
 MATT: So as you guys rest, the evening's light eventually comes to a darkened sky, the storm slowly begins to pass while the sky still remains somewhat cloudy, the stars not visible. It appears that the heavy waterfall from the air above has come to a patter, to a halt. As you prep for the tension of the evening's choices, we'll go ahead and take a break. Be back here in just a moment, guys. 
 SAM: High action.
 MATT: (laughing) This is some unique excursions into the city today.
 TRAVIS: I'm so happy.
 MARISHA: Iva!
 TRAVIS: I remember my 12 and 13-year-old excursions into the back of the comic book store with the 18 and up section. Oh man. “How old are you kid?” “Pretty old.”
 LAURA: You probably got away with it. You looked like you were 30 when you were 18.
 MATT: Before we go to break, guys, it'll be our Wyrmwood giveaway. This giveaway now is the cherry deck box. Which is a nice wood style, you can look inside, you get your fancy interior for your card decks and other things you want to hide in there. Ooh, it smells nice too.

 Part II Edit 
 MATT: Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome back.
 TALIESIN: That was a sniper shot.
 MATT: First, before we dive back in we have our winner of the evening, it is Areski14! Congratulations, Areski14.
 TRAVIS: A risky 14?
 MATT: Areski.
 TRAVIS: Areski!
 MATT: A-R-E-S-K-I 14, congratulations! We'll get that to you ASAP. As you have taken the afternoon to rest within The Leaky Tap tavern, and the midnight meeting looming, what would you guys, if anything, you want to do anything or do you want to wait until the time transpires?
 SAM: You guys want to go anywhere? Pumat told me that the Hall of Erudition is really cool and has some cool things in it if we wanted to check it out. Or! We could go kill The Gentleman!
 MARISHA: Go kill-- 
 SAM: I don't know, is that what we're supposed to do? Kill The Gentleman?
 LAURA: I don't think we're going to kill him right off the bat.
 SAM: Kill him!
 MARISHA: That feels a little premature.
 TRAVIS: We don't even know who he is yet, right?
 SAM: Well, we could introduce ourselves and then kill him!
 LAURA: He could have a whole infrastructure of people supporting him and then they would come after us.
 MARISHA: I want to know who he is, though.
 LAURA: Yeah.
 MARISHA: Super interested to find out who this guy is. I feel like we should deal with one thing-- I'm super focused on this current--
 TRAVIS: I am too.
 LAURA: I mean we could hang out in the lobby in this bar, and I could watch every person that comes inside. I could draw their picture and know every single patron that's in here so that we have something to turn into the guards when we rat everybody out.
 SAM: Ooh!
 TALIESIN: That's a very good idea.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, and I was thinking. So the three of us are down in the meeting.
 SAM: Who's going down?
 TRAVIS: The three of us. Nott, if you could be outside, letting us know if any crownsguard or other surly types look like they're coming in to raid the place, you send a Message, and then you two run interference if they actually make it inside the doors, in case we haven't made it out yet.
 LAURA: Just be distracting!
 TRAVIS: Yeah, whatever you do, buy us some time.
 LAURA: We're good at that.
 TALIESIN: We can be very distracting.
 TRAVIS: I believe you.
 MARISHA: Last thing we want is to take the fall for these assholes, whoever they are.
 TRAVIS: These Knights of Requital.
 LAURA: We will hang out up here and just be weird. 
 MATT: You guys spend the remainder of the evening waiting for this to transpire, some patrons come in, some leave. You're reading through the book?
 MARISHA: Read the book!
 LAURA: Oh yeah, I have the "Tusk Love" too.
 MARISHA: You go back and forth.
 LAURA: I read it and I keep looking at Fjord like-- and then go back and read it. I assume it's about some sort of orc love.
 MATT: It is, actually.
 TRAVIS: (laughing) Damn it. Son of a bitch.
 MATT: It deals with the union of half-orc and the daughter of a traveling merchant as they meet on the Amber Road up near Druvenlode. It goes into a saucy union between the two, but they can't, because what would the parents think? Yeah.
 LAURA: What's the name of the half-orc?
 MATT: Oskar. With a K. Oskar.
 TRAVIS: What you reading there, Jester?
 LAURA: Nothing, Oskar. Don't worry about it.
 (laughter)
 MATT: Oh man. Beau, as you're reading through the book, it's interesting. It begins to talk about the conflict between the Julous Dominion and the Dwendalian Empire.
 MARISHA: Conflict between the Julous Dominion?
 MATT: Yes, the Julous Dominion and the Dwendalian Empire. You're uncertain-- Make a history check?
 MARISHA: Dwendalian Emp. That's good, 17.
 MATT: It begins to name generals and figures caught in this political conflict in the center. Remembering back to your studies, these names don't ring a bell. Either they're obscure or fictional for the purposes of the story. However, it does speak of a Crick assassin that had snuck its way past the borders during the conflict, and had attempted to take the life of a general named Theo.
 MARISHA: Theo, okay.
 SAM and MARISHA: Theo!
 MATT: Rudy! 
 LIAM: Oh no.
 MARISHA: Ruined forever.
 MATT: Blame lots of Cosbys for that one. Sorry. The failed assassination attempt led to the capture of the assassin during, essentially, a test of wits between the general and this assassin--
 MARISHA: Okay, test of wits. Like, Dinner with Andre style?
 MATT: Kind of, yeah. The assassin's been captured, removes the helmet, and behind is revealed to be--
 MARISHA: The assassin removed his helmet?
 MATT: The assassin's helmet was removed by the general after being caught.
 LAURA: That's the helmet we found in the graveyard!
 MATT: It's not very good smut, at least at this point.
 MARISHA: Wait, am I writing down smut right now?
 TRAVIS, MATT, and LIAM: Yes.
 TRAVIS: Of course you are. In size 38 font in your fucking notebook.
 MARISHA: Hang on. Are you going into how Theo and the assassin had a thing?
 MATT: Yes. We're getting there.
 MARISHA: Okay, keep going. I'm into it, though. This has to be important!
 TRAVIS: Does it?
 MARISHA: He's telling it to me!
 SAM: Just listen!
 MATT: The assassin is revealed to be from the Kryn Empire of Xhorhas, with dark blue-purple skin, gray-white hair, and pointed ears of elvish lineage.
 TRAVIS: No, leave it alone. Stop. 
 MARISHA: He's a dark elf, right? Or a drow?
 MATT: She is. It's a female dark elf. The armor is described to be chitinous, almost organic in its design, though metal. You learn a little bit. It goes into a discussion of the term “Crick.” The term “Crick” is actually a slur against the people that come from the Xhorhasian side of Wildemount. It's short for cricket because supposedly when the Kryn armies charge into battle, there are designed holes and tubes in the armor that sounds like a flock of crickets rushing into battle. It's meant as an intimidation tactic. It's this high-pitched screaming cricket chirp that rushes in, so that's where the term “Crick” comes from. It is used in a derogatory fashion towards individuals who live within the empire of Xhorhas and Kryn. The book talks about them dueling wits, finding common ground, and getting angry at each other and murderous, then turns into this torrid love affair in this very Anthony/Cleopatra feel to it. It's very dry. It's an older book. It doesn't match some of the imaginatory flair of some of the other smut that you briefly perused as you were walking in the bookstore earlier. You glean a little bit of information, should this be accurate at all, of some of the relationships or dynamics of the empire and the Xhorhasian folk that live beyond the border.
 MARISHA: Would I be able to discern where the assassin entered into the city?
 MATT: No, it's not a detailed historical book.
 MARISHA: It's not like, "by the third lamppost, remove this brick." Okay, cool.
 MATT: There we go.
 MARISHA: This book sucks.
 LIAM: How far in are you?
 MARISHA: Halfway, maybe.
 LIAM: How long have you been working on it?
 MARISHA: Couple hours.
 MATT: As the evening clocks in close to midnight and the majority of the patrons begin to dwindle and scatter into the night air, you watch as Ulog enters quietly, gives a nod of knowing towards the two of you, then, on his own, steps down into the cellar. About ten minutes or so later, you watch as Kara, the half-elf girl you had met before, enters, gives you a glance, but doesn't acknowledge anything, orders a drink, leans against the wall, then eventually disappears down into the cellar as well. Later on, you watch as Dolan, the human you had spoke with, that seemed to be the one spearheading this meeting before, enters with another human male. They both look back and forth, acknowledge you guys. The two of them eventually splinter off to different sides of the room, waiting. One, and a few minutes later, the other down into the cellar area.
 TRAVIS: Did we recognize the other human male that he's with?
 MATT: No.
 TRAVIS: Does he seem to be armed, or shady, or have lots of scars on his person?
 MATT: Make a perception check.
 TRAVIS: 13.
 MATT: 13. Hard to tell at this distance. You didn't see any visible or apparent scars or anything that gave you a sense of shiftiness, other than the careful demeanor. It didn't look to be a face of a rugged soldier, by any means.
 LAURA: Did it look like an undercover cop, trying to blend in?
 TALIESIN: How were his shoes?
 MATT: Make an insight check.
 TRAVIS: "How were his shoes."
 TALIESIN: Like nice loafers?
 LAURA: 20.
 MATT: Seems nervous, but not in a way that triggers your spider-sense, so to speak. 
 SAM: Are you guys still up top? Okay, I'm going to go over to Fjord and say: You said that one of the members of their group is named Dolan?
 TRAVIS: That's right, yeah.
 SAM: If it comes up, no big, could you find out that guy's last name?
 TRAVIS: Dolan's last name?
 SAM: Yeah.
 TRAVIS: Sure. Any reason why?
 SAM: I know a guy named Dolan Taverski.
 TRAVIS: Taverski?
 SAM: I don't really know, Taverski. I don't know. I’ve heard it. Just find out his last name!
 TRAVIS: Sure. Is this guy from where you're from or something? Old mate of yours?
 SAM: No, just have something of his.
 TRAVIS: Taverski. Would he know you if I was like, "Hey, friend of ours named Nott--"
 SAM: No, nope, would not know me.
 TALIESIN: Insight check, watching this?
 SAM: Natural 20.
 TALIESIN: 16.
 MATT: 16 total? You get no bead on the wild words that are coming out of her mouth.
 TALIESIN: What are-- no, never mind.
 TRAVIS: I'll find out his last name. I'm sure he won't mind.
 SAM: I'll be up here. If I see anything suspicious, I'm going to Message you.
 TRAVIS: That's right. Crownsguard, rough-looking types, people that are armed, right?
 SAM: Don't worry, I'll keep an eye out. I'll be in disguise. I'm going to cast Disguise Self on myself, turning myself into a halfling with red hair, green eyes, a hawkish nose, overalls, thinning on top, too-big shoes.
 TRAVIS: It's your best disguise yet.
 SAM: Yeah? 
 TRAVIS: Nott? Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot it was you for a minute. 
 SAM: Call me a code name.
 TRAVIS: Oh, T-ton.
 SAM: T-ton. Yes.
 MARISHA: Yeah. T-ton it is.
 TRAVIS: T-ton. Yeah. 
 LIAM: The second T is silent.
 SAM: I'm going to go outside and stand at the front door.
 LAURA: Should we be outside too? Or should we stay inside? 
 SAM: No, you're supposed to stay inside. If I see anyone coming, you distract them.
 LAURA: How will we know if you see anyone coming? 
 SAM: I will tell you with my Message spell. 
 LAURA: Okay, you will Message us, and then you will Message the others? 
 SAM: I don't know. I don't use it a lot. 
 LAURA: Can you do it twice? 
 SAM: I think I can do it twice. I can do it twice. 
 LAURA: Okay.
 TALIESIN: Well, that'll work then. 
 LAURA: Then, we'll just hang out in here and have some fun. 
 TALIESIN: Ah, yes.
 TRAVIS: You ready? 
 MARISHA: Yeah. Let's do this. 
 TRAVIS: Let's see what they want to do. 
 MARISHA: Okay. 
 MATT: Who all is going down? It's you three? 
 TALIESIN: Table one.
 TRAVIS: It's these three jackasses.
 MARISHA: Table right. 
 MATT: So you guys keep watch. 
 LAURA: Yes.
 MATT: As you descend into the cellar below, you can see there's a table already set up with a few chairs around. There are two oil lamps that are turned low, and the four figures you saw enter are all sitting around, waiting. As you begin to descend, they give a knowing nod, and gesture to please take a seat. 
 MARISHA: Is it just the four of them? No more? 
 MATT: Just the four of them. 
 MARISHA: Okay. 
 TRAVIS: I'll take a seat.
 MARISHA: Yeah, we sit. It's polite. 
 MATT: As you enter, Dolan, the one who was leading before, sits up and goes, "I'm sorry-- what?"
 LIAM: Oh, I'm with my friends here, they've shared a bit of what is gone on here and I'm sympathetic. 
 TRAVIS: We haven't said too much, but we thought that he might be somebody you'd be interested in. Very clever, has no love for the Empire. 
 MARISHA: A valuable asset. Good with... things. 
 TRAVIS: Thought we could let you decide for yourself.
 MATT: They look to each other. "Have a seat."
 LIAM: Thank you. 
 TRAVIS: Caleb, this is Dolan. Dolan, this is Caleb. Dolan, do you have a last name? 
 MATT: They glance about. "Dolan Thrym."
 MARISHA: Thrym.
 MATT: "This is Horris Thrym, my partner." The man you saw enter earlier.
 MARISHA: The human male?
 MATT: Yes. "You know Kara and Ulog. What was your name again, you said?"
 LIAM: Caleb.
 MATT: "Caleb. Thank you very much for meeting us. Ulog has been-- and please, take no offense, we're just very careful-- keeping a very close eye on your activities since we last met. Bit of a scare as you entered the King's Hall, but I've heard that you've done a bit of business, unrelated. He speaks to your skill and we may have--" He looks nervously over, and Horris leans forward and goes, "We put two months into planning something, and it requires certain skill sets. Ulog, if you'd like to elaborate on this." The dwarf leans forward, pulls one of the lanterns closer, so all your faces brighten up just a bit. He turns the wick up a bit. "So we've intercepted some documents to Lord Sutan, one of the pretty faces and money grabbers over there in the Tri-Spire. Very politically connected. Apparently, he's been doing some business with a lowlife who's known in the more crown-based circles as one of those arrest-on-sight types. We believe this individual might be involved with The Myriad. "We tried to bring this information to the Lawmaster, Orentha, as she is a friend of Dolan's. However, we were intercepted by the High-Richter Prucine. She's about as corrupt as you get in the structure here in Zadash. She intercepted it, so that she delivered the information. I've heard nothing since. A couple of our members have been closely watched by the Crownsguard ever since. So we believe the High-Richter might be in on it. We've decided if we can somehow turn Lord Sutan against the High-Richter, and then expose them to the Lawmaster, they'll either be arrested or ousted from their positions. Which, one, would be victory for those who do not want to live under the claws of corruption in this city. And two, vacates the position of High-Richter. While Horris' practice may have been irrevocably damaged in the public eye, Dolan is a respected member of the society here. The locals at least. We believe that, if not the High-Richter himself, perhaps another position as things shift. It would behoove us--" Dolan puts his hand up and says, "It would be helpful to have at least one of us with an ear on the bead of the inner circle of how law is distributed within Zadash. While it is not my bailiwick, people seem to trust me, and I think that's the most important thing when taking an office. We've outlined a means of doing so. This is where we may need your help." Looks over to Kara, and the half-elf leans forward, "All right then, so, the current plan is to infiltrate the Lord Sutan's estate in the Tri-Spire, steal a copy of his wax seal, and his handwriting. After we forge a little of the correspondence to this unsavory individual who he was speaking to in this letter, we make a new one that writes about an assassination of the High-Richter, sealed, and signed by the Lord Sutan. Then, we infiltrate the home of the High-Richter, tear apart the living space, look like it's been tousled and tossed, like someone was seeking her while she was out for the night, at a local ball, which she'll be one night from here. Before she returns to find her place destroyed, we take this letter that we found and left it, hidden within her room. She finds the letter, brings it to the Lawmaster--" At this point, Ulog pipes in real fast, "Sorry, misunderstood. She doesn't get the letter. We deliver it ourselves to the Lawmaster. I don't trust her to take it."
 LAURA: (laughs) This is like us planning.
 TALIESIN: Wow. 
 MATT: You get the sense that they're not the most organized or experienced at this, but they're trying their hand at doing something that changes, hopefully, the status quo they're used to. "So, we deliver the letter to the High-Richter, or the Lawmaster. I prefer the High-Richter in front of the Lawmaster, if we can get the two in the same room, so there's no escape. We see her angry-infused, then they begin to create turmoil. Then, we expose them both, have them dropped or arrested, leaving the vacant spot, and they're out.
 TRAVIS: Well, I have one question. This Lord Sutan? What's to keep the High-Richter and the Lawmaster from just going and snatching him up and putting him in chains?
 MATT: "Wait, from who?" Dolan puts his hand up and says, "I'm sorry, reiterate that?"
 TRAVIS: Yeah, well, we're going to forge this letter from Lord Sutan, right? Saying that there's an assassination attempt against the Richter. We go to the Richter's place, we tossle it, then we deliver a letter from Sutan, saying there was an attempt of the Richter's life. So if I was the Richter, and I went to the Lawmaster, I'd just go disappear Lord Sutan. Your Richter will stay in his seat, and you'll be short one Lord, if I'm not mistaken.
 MARISHA: Especially considering you said the Richter was already pretty corrupted. Seems like assassination attempts in reverse wouldn't be out of her bailiwick.
 MATT: "What do you suggest, then?"
 MARISHA: Here's my question to Dolan, why do you want-- Horris wants to be in the office?
 MATT: No, Dolan is to be elevated. Horris is taking a back seat.
 TRAVIS: Horris, if you don't mind me asking, what was your practice?
 MATT: "I was a physician."
 TRAVIS: As well.
 MATT: "We had a practice together. One of us had to take the fall. I accepted it myself. Dolan couldn't-- Dolan has too much at stake."
 MARISHA: Dolan, what makes you think that you can beat the system that you would then be joining?
 MATT: "Well, the system's too big for us to deconstruct from the outside. At the very least, I can hope to improve it from the inside. I know the Lawmaster is a good woman. There are good people in there. But if we can root out the cancers, the tumors that threaten to make it what it is, and what it could become, that's something. We have to try."
 TRAVIS: I'm not shy of a conscience. I'm afraid I'd need to know a little bit more about this High-Richter Prucine. Hopefully, he's a terrible individual.
 MATT: "She. And yes. She has been responsible--" Ulog, at this point, you can see his fingers gritting into the table. "She's the one who put my wife in that blasted prison."
 TRAVIS: I remember you saying that.
 MARISHA: Yeah, sorry about that.
 TRAVIS: I mean, I hate to say anything else without seeing something for ourselves. You seem to have a good plan for getting rid of Sutan, but it seems you might need some further measures to get rid of this Richter as well.
 MATT: "We have been discussing that. If you have any suggestions, please."
 MARISHA: Well, you could do a lot with a seal from a lord. A lot more than claiming an assassination attempt. Just throwing it out there.
 MATT: "Like?"
 MARISHA: Literally anything else.
 TRAVIS: Do you feel like the Empire, or the Lawmaster, is onto your group? Your Knights of Requital? Do they know your name?
 LIAM: Yeah, you have already mentioned that some of your people were followed and eyed.
 MATT: "They don't, to my knowledge, know of the group. Just some of the individuals."
 LIAM: Which ones, specifically? 
 MATT: "Well, there is Themond, but he's left, and has not gone to a meeting since he's started to be followed. He was the one who delivered the letter to the High-Richter. It was mainly-- nothing directly related to our meetings and more just the delivery of our intercepted letter."
 TRAVIS: I have a proposal for you. Are you one hundred percent sure that they haven't heard of your name, Knights of Requital? How attached are you to that name?
 MATT: "Not. It wasn't something we chose, it just emerged from our meetings."
 TRAVIS: If you ever want someone to stop looking for something-- they'll stop as soon as they know that thing is gone, or dead. So how about we frame High-Richter Prucine as the head of this Knights of Requital and let the law handle it the way they will. And we'll take care of Lord Sutan at the same time.
 MATT: They all look to each other, and back. There's a little bit of a smile, curls across Horris’ face. He nods, "I think this is a pretty sound step in the right direction." 
 
TRAVIS: I hate to do away with a great name, but you work with what you have.
 MARISHA: It's an okay name.
 TRAVIS: You could workshop it.
 MARISHA: You could workshop it. There's always more names.
 MATT: "Do we leave evidence of correspondence in the home of the High-Richter, then?"
 TRAVIS: Do you have any secret symbols? Or stamps or seals that you use for communication that we could plant in the house, or the place of dwelling of the High-Richter? A ring, a piece of jewelry?
 MATT: "No. We've been very careful not to do that. We could fabricate some."
 MARISHA: There was also the notice on the King's Hall looking for y'all. I don't know if you knew that, by the way. I imagine a notice in one of these people's houses might mean that they have concern of being found.
 TRAVIS: If we frame this the right way, it sure would do a lot for your ambitions to become that High-Richter, Dolan, if you were the ones to turn in the evidence.
 MARISHA: You could win twice.
 MATT: Dolan pipes up, "I'm worried about turning in evidence, because there's nothing that could connect it to the spot. However, if we could plant evidence in the estate of the High-Richter, and convince the Lawmaster, I believe if we speak to her, she would at least do an investigation. They'd find this evidence in the home, in the right place. That could be enough."
 TRAVIS: I think it would be.
 MARISHA: Now, the Lawmaster works under the High-Richter, right?
 MATT: "The Lawmaster works above the High-Richter."
 TRAVIS: Yeah. This will work.
 MARISHA: Yeah.
 MATT: You hear a (thump, hiss) as Ulog has pulled the cork of a small bottle of ale that was sitting there for a while, and begins to drink. 
 TRAVIS: Is her name Kara?
 MARISHA: Kara, I think it's Kara.
 TRAVIS: Kara, I like the enthusiasm you had about your plan. What sort of skills could you bring to this equation? Are you stealthy? Sneaky?
 MATT: "Honestly, more of a thinker. Ulog, however--" She points to the dwarf again, who has finished drinking, "Yeah, I used to run with some pretty shifty lot. Done a bit of burglary in my past."
 MARISHA: I like that. Tell us about this Myriad, a little bit. What is it exactly that you guys are so nervous about with these people?
 MATT: "We're not nervous about the Myriad, other than the fact that the Myriad's a bunch of fuckheads that steal, enslave, and push all sorts of unsavory business. They're the mirror side to the bullshit the Empire does. For all that, we want to make sure that if we can connect any of them to the Myriad, and Lord Sutan is definitely connected: two birds, one stone. But then we have to plant evidence in two.”
 TRAVIS: That can be done. We have other associates, upstairs. We didn't want to encroach too much on your space. We'd like time to confer with them over the night, perhaps meet again midday tomorrow. We should find a new spot, though. Repetition is a recipe for disaster.
 MATT: Dolan sits back. "It's a good point. Any recommendations?"
 TRAVIS: We're actually quite new. Maybe you could provide one.
 MATT: He thinks for a moment. Through his paperwork.
 TRAVIS: Consult your paperwork.
 TALIESIN: Allow me to collect my additional notes.
 MATT: Shut up.
 SAM: "Shut up."
 MATT: "How about The Song and Supper Inn?"
 TRAVIS: Song and Supper Inn?
 MATT: "It's on the west side of the Interstead Sprawl."
 SAM: The SAS.
 TRAVIS: How far from here? How much time to travel? Not far?
 MATT: "Maybe 40 minutes on foot."
 TRAVIS: Fair enough. Shall we call it just after noon tomorrow?
 MARISHA: What name should we be looking for?
 MATT: They all look at each other. Kara leans forward, "Let's say-- The Inquiry."
 TRAVIS: The Inquiry. It's got a nice ring to it.
 MATT: "Thank you. I appreciate that."
 TRAVIS: Thank you for trusting us. I believe we can make quite the impact with these movements.
 MATT: Dolan nods and smiles. Looks to Horris, looks to the other two. "Thank you. We've been needing more than just angry voices of half-enthused common folk. People of action are hard to find that seem to have a trusted heart."
 MARISHA: I'll give you one piece of advice, Dolan, though. I would challenge you to think about this for the night, think real long and hard, if you're willing to jump into the ring. Some pretty high-ranking asshole gladiators. Should probably be willing to take a few licks. Shut up. I was trying to go "before you jump into the ring with Muhammad Ali" type of thing, but Muhammad Ali isn't here. If you're willing to jump into the ring with some pretty high ranking asshole gladiators, you should probably be willing to take a few licks. Shut up!
 LAURA: Taking a few licks? 
 MARISHA: I was trying to, you know, make sure before you jump in the ring with Muhammad Ali type of thing, but Muhammad Ali isn't here. 
 LAURA: Yeah, lick those gladiator assholes!
 MATT: Dolan’s stare goes a little distant as he tries to fully comprehend the gravity of your statement before slowly nodding. 
 TRAVIS: You see Fjord shift his weight.
 MARISHA: You know, make sure you know what you're getting into. 
 MATT: "I will." 
 MARISHA: Awful people.
 MATT: "I will take that into consideration. Thank you."
 MARISHA: Powerful tricks. That's all. 
 MATT: "I appreciate that. And you, I guess as we begin to put this together, what are your specialties?" 
 LIAM: I dabble a bit in the arcane, nothing too impressive, but a little more than nothing. 
 MATT: "Good. Very well then, tomorrow afternoon, The Song and Supper.”
 TRAVIS: Would you like to exit first or should we?
 MATT: Ulog leans forward a bit and goes, "After you." 
 TRAVIS: Much obliged. I head out. 
 LIAM: I'll go along with Fjord. 
 MATT: Make a perception check. 
 SAM: 17. 
 MATT: No strange behavior, there doesn't seem to be any business or activity towards the back or the alley. Nothing that catches your eye to be suspicious or encroaching upon the meeting below. 
 SAM: Everything’s okay!
 TRAVIS: Wow, louder than I thought it would be. Thank you, Nott.
 SAM: You can reply to this message.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, thank you for keeping an eye out. Would you like to join us inside? 
 SAM: I can't reply. 
 TRAVIS: Nott? Would you like to-- Hello? 
 SAM: Six seconds. Yes! You can reply to this message!
 MATT: You all regather in the center of The Leaky Tap tavern.
 TALIESIN: You come from being touched by some kind of primordial chaos magic, something powerful, strange, creative, and bizarre. You've recently had everything turned upside down-- 
 LAURA: I really have!
 TALIESIN: And have started a new path. The path you are walking is not the one you were expecting. It's not the one you're going to find. It's true! You are walking towards some destiny. 
 LAURA: Does it say which one? 
 TALIESIN: Just not the one you're expecting. 
 LAURA: This is weird.
 TALIESIN: I only did three cards.
 LAURA: These are really, really, really good.
 TALIESIN: Thank you.
 LAURA: That's a good fortune. 
 SAM: Hello, strangers! 
 LAURA: You have a booger on the tip of your nose.
 SAM: I'm just a traveling halfling!
 LAURA: Oh! I just told a random person they had a booger on the tip of their nose. 
 SAM: Yeah, I'm just a random person. 
 TALIESIN: To be fair, you would tell a random person they have a booger on their nose.
 LAURA: You're a random person with a really familiar voice, though. You need to talk to Fjord, and see if you can figure out how to sound different. 
 TRAVIS: Thanks for keeping an eye out. 
 SAM: How did it go? 
 MARISHA: Crazy! 
 TRAVIS and MARISHA: Yeah.
 TRAVIS: Caleb, impressions?
 LAURA: You were down there a really long time. 
 LIAM: What is the benefit for us? 
 TRAVIS: Well, my takeaway is that they want to unseat some of the corrupted seats of power here in the city. If that's true, if there is an abuse of power, I'm all for removing those corrupted seats and putting people of worth in their place. I'm also not keen on taking the word of someone else without getting some evidence of our own. 
 MARISHA: I agree. Who knows? We can't be replacing someone corrupt with someone even worse. 
 LAURA: We should follow one of them. 
 MARISHA: Yeah, we don't know anything about this Dolan, this Horris' motives, or their agenda. 
 TRAVIS: We don't. While we're following them, perhaps we should try and find out what we can about this-- Lean in closer. Closer. This High-Richter Prucine. 
 LAURA: Have the ones downstairs already left? 
 TRAVIS: I don't know. 
 MATT: At this point, you see Ulog make his way up and take a different table at the far corner. Then slowly, over the next 15 or so minutes, the other three exit the building.
 SAM: Want me to follow them?
 MARISHA: Should we go now? 
 SAM: I'm going! 
 LAURA: Wait, blessings!
 SAM: Oh, thank you! 
 LIAM: I send Frumpkin after her. 
 MATT: Make a stealth check, please. 
 LAURA: It's like a dry skin. You got it!
 SAM: Thanks. 
 TRAVIS: I couldn't see it. 
 LAURA: Stealth role. With advantage! 
 SAM: Stealth role? Okay, not good. Worse. 18. 
 MATT: Which one are you following? There's the half elf--
 SAM: Do I know any of their names?
 MATT: There's two human men and then there is the dwarf male. 
 MARISHA: We would have told you the two humans. Two humans. 
 SAM: The two humans. Are they traveling together? 
 MATT: They are. You follow them for the next 20 or so minutes before they come to a modest home. It's in a little bit of disrepair especially in the recent the recent storm; part of the roof is sinking inward a little bit. They enter, close and lock the door behind them. They glance through the window and they have a heated conversation back and forth. If you want to listen, make a perception check. 
 LIAM: I have a hand on Beau's shoulder--
 SAM: Nine. 
 ALL: Nine!
 MATT: It's going to be a thing forever. 
 TRAVIS: Yeah it should be every time. It's a rule. 
 MARISHA: House rule.
 MATT: It's hard to hear. It's muffled; the wall’s thick. It's not an argument, more of a lot of passionate conversation back and forth, some aggressive counter points to some sort of conversation. Eventually they both settle down with a bottle of wine, and you glance through the window. You see the one with the blond hair is sobbing into his arms at a table, and--
 SAM: This is a man?
 MATT: They're both men. The other one has his arm around the other and consoles him. Looking inside, you see it's a lot of books across the wall, you recognize there are some alchemical vials or other things that similar-type glass containers that can be utilized for that. Some dried roots are hanging from the wall. A lot of them appear to be medicinal in nature. After about 20 minutes or so of watching this, nothing strange catches your eye. It seems like two people winding down after a stressful day. 
 LIAM: Are any of those books of an arcane nature, because I'm also looking?
 MATT: Make a perception roll for Frumpkin.
 LIAM: I'm looking through Frumpkin. Very bad. 
 LAURA: She basically looks like a Pennywise, like a teeny Pennywise creeping through the---
 MARISHA: Yeah, just a clown. 
 MATT: Oh my god, it does! 
 LIAM: Just an eight. 
 MATT: It's too hard to see from the outside. You can barely tell there are books there. The very low light there is inside, you can't make out any details. 
 SAM: It's a single level house? Nothing fancy about it?
 MATT: Single level house, it might be two rooms. No, it's not quite like impoverished, but it's not--
 SAM: Any papers? Any weapons visible? 
 MATT: You do see a heavy crook of some kind, like a staff with a big heavy wooden knot at the end. It can be used to defend oneself and also as a walking stick. A shillelagh if you will. You can see a general shortsword that is put on a belt that is hung on a wall, but nothing in there that is militarized. 
 SAM: I guess that's all I can glean from this. I'll knock on the door, and then run away before they can see. 
 MATT: Immediately inside you hear some rustling and all the lights inside go out and it goes dark. You run away. 
 SAM: Oh interesting. 
 MARISHA: Actually, that was pretty cool. You learned something!
 SAM: I'll go back and report to my friends. And that's what I saw, Caleb, and the others of you who are not my friends, I'll also tell. Just kidding guys, I love you. 
 TRAVIS: You can drop that.
 SAM: This is who I am now. I'm sure it's run out by now.
 MATT: It lasts for an hour. It's probably run out by now. 
 TRAVIS: You know what we also need? I want some eyes on this High-Richter. 
 MARISHA: I agree.
 TRAVIS: We should find out where she lives and how she treats people, see if the stories are true. 
 LAURA: Maybe tomorrow morning we can go spy on her house. 
 MARISHA: Yeah, maybe we can even split a team, some people go and spy on the house, some people maybe go to the stockade, talk to the people she's locked up?
 TRAVIS: Sure. We might need to find out where she lives tonight, though. 
 MARISHA: I'm down for that. 
 TRAVIS: I should have asked, but I forgot. 
 MARISHA: Well, is Ulog still sitting at the other table? 
 MATT: At this point, he's probably left. It's been about an hour since you returned. 
 LAURA: It's hard to find that out without seeming suspicious, isn't it?
 TRAVIS: No, the High-Richter is just an official. 
 LAURA: But isn't it weird to go "Where does the High-Richter live?"
 TRAVIS: Not if you have official business with the Richter.
 LAURA: Oh, okay. 
 MARISHA: At this hour? 
 TRAVIS: It's very urgent business. 
 SAM: We could find out how the High-Richter treats people by posing as people in need.
 TRAVIS: Exactly what I was going to suggest. 
 MARISHA: Interesting.
 LAURA: Let's disguise ourselves.
 TRAVIS: Well, we don't need to, Caleb--
 SAM: As clowns?
 LAURA: Yeah!
 LIAM: I'm sorry, I did not catch all of the meeting that you went to the other night. Are they paying anything? Are we doing this for altruistic reasons? 
 TALIESIN: That is a very good question. I second that question.
 MARISHA: I don't do anything for altruistic reasons. 
 TALIESIN: I've never done anything for free in my entire life.
 LIAM: So has anything been discussed in advance, is all I'm asking. 
 MARISHA: Well, if this plan gets pulled off, and we help Dolan get in that seat of the High-Richter, than we suddenly have friends in high places. And I *love* an owed favor.
 TRAVIS: To answer Caleb's question, we kind of forgot to discuss that part. 
 MATT: You did.
 TRAVIS: We're new at this. We will address that tomorrow, for sure, before we proceed any further. You're right, there should be compensation. 
 LAURA: Do you want the rest of us to go tomorrow, or do we still need to be look out?
 TRAVIS: No, I think we should all go. They should get a look at us as a whole, see who they're dealing with, just in case there is any shady shit. 
 LAURA: Should we look like ourselves or other people?
 TRAVIS: What would you like to look like?
 LAURA: I don't care. 
 TRAVIS: It's at your discretion.
 LAURA: Okay. I'll decide on the day. 
 TRAVIS: Anybody feel like finding out where this High-Richter lives this evening?
 SAM: Yeah! Yeah!
 TRAVIS: Let's do it. How do we do that?
 LAURA: Maybe we can ask the owner of here. 
 MARISHA: Yeah. 
 TRAVIS: That's a great idea.
 MARISHA: Start there, why not?
 TRAVIS: Jester.
 LAURA: Yes?
 TRAVIS: Charm him, ask. 
 LAURA: Okay, I'm going to go ask Claudia. 
 MATT: It is about 1:00, 1:30 in the morning though.
 LAURA: Oh, it's already that late. 
 MATT: You guys met around midnight. So you can go try and wake up Claudia, if you'd like. 
 LAURA: Claudia's not awake?
 MATT: Not at the moment. 
 TRAVIS: What about that big white dragonborn, maybe he knows?
 LAURA: Maybe the barkeep?
 MATT: Wessek is there. Wessek is sitting back, it's a very slow night. 
 LAURA: Hey Wessek.
 MATT: "Hello, little blue girl, what can I do for you?"
 LAURA: How's it going with you? It's really late. 
 MATT: "It is very late, and I'm sort of wondering what you're bothering me with this late? I'm curious."
 LAURA: Well, I just remembered that I was supposed to deliver a personal message to the High-Richter, and I can't remember where they live. Do you know?
 MATT: "Sorry, I don't."
 LAURA: Do you know what area of town it would be in?
 MATT: "I couldn't tell you. The High-Richter is pretty, well, pretty high up there."
 LAURA: Probably like the Tri-Spires or something.
 MATT: "Most likely, or at least somewhere where it's official. It’s my guess."
 LAURA: Okay, that was a fun conversation, goodbye. 
 MATT: "Goodbye!"
 MARISHA: Is The Pillow Trove still open? 
 LAURA: The Pillow Trove is an inn, of course it's open. 
 MARISHA: We can try and ask there, huh? 
 TALIESIN: Getting in would be a little tricky, you'd have to get by the guards.
 SAM: It's 1:00 in the morning. 
 TRAVIS: Yeah. Perhaps we should rest tonight and plan this little needy-folk charade in the morning. We can always take the sewers into the Tri-Spires.
 MARISHA: I know, that's what I was thinking.
 LAURA: (yawning) We totally can. 
 LIAM: What did you say?
 LAURA: I said we totally can do that. 
 TRAVIS: Caleb, you've mentioned you tried to get into the Tri-Spires and you had a disguise on, and it didn't--
 LIAM: I did not have a--oh yeah. There is some sort of wards on the gates there. It's something I've done 100 times in small towns. I tried to disguise myself, and there was nothing there, they saw right through it, and they were dicks about it. 
 TRAVIS: Do you think it was just in that passage way or do you think it's the entire Tri-Spire area?
 LAURA: I feel like that would be a really big enchantment to put on the the entire thing. 
 LIAM: It is not the entire Tri-Spire, because--
 TRAVIS: The entire Tri-Spire?
 LIAM: No, not. Not Nott, it is not. I cased the smut shop, I looked for arcane things there and did not, well. But I was able to use my abilities. 
 TRAVIS: That'll be it. We use the sewers to get in, disguise ourselves, avoid detection, find out what we need to know.
 TALIESIN: I can work with this plan.
 LAURA: I like it.
 TRAVIS: Shall we retire for the night?
 MARISHA and SAM: Yes.
 TRAVIS: I'll head up to my room first and I'll pull Molly up with me, because I need to have a word with him. Molly, listen. I can't get over the fact that Nott was going through my stuff. I want to set a little bit of a trap.
 TALIESIN: Oh, you want to set some sort of trap or example for her?
 TRAVIS: Yeah. I just want to see if she's learned her lesson or not.
 TALIESIN: Sure.
 TRAVIS: I'm going to put an object in the middle of the room with our door open, and we're going to hide out of sight. You game?
 TALIESIN: This seems a little unfair. Sure.
 TRAVIS: Great. I'll use Minor Illusion to put in the middle of the room a bundle of buttons with a tall, shiny flask covered in jewels, right in the middle of the room.
 TALIESIN: Do we want to put down some ball bearings? I've got a big bag of them.
 TRAVIS: I mean, I guess so. Once she's in, we're going to shut the door. I want to figure out what the fuck she's sneaking around for.
 TALIESIN: That'll do.
 TRAVIS: Okay.
 MATT: So both of you guys go and hide? Stealth check from both of you.
 TRAVIS: 16.
 TALIESIN: 11.
 MATT: You have a passive perception of--?
 SAM: 12 or something? Right? Where is it?
 LAURA: Probably 13.
 MATT: No, passive perception I believe for you is--
 SAM: Ten.
 LAURA: Really?
 MATT: As you all go to bed, what are you doing?
 MARISHA: Sleeping.
 MATT: You guys go to sleep--
 LIAM: Oh, wait, I knock on Jester and Beauregard's door.
 LAURA: (gasps) What is it that you want, knocking on our door so late at night, Caleb?
 MARISHA and TRAVIS: You've been reading too much smut.
 (laughter)
 MARISHA: No more Oskar for you.
 LAURA: What is it, Caleb?
 SAM: (sultrily) I brought my tusk.
 LIAM: You are turning in?
 MARISHA: Should I not?
 LIAM: No, by all means, but I have changed my mind. I feel guilty for discarding the book that you purchased for me and I was wondering if I could read it tonight, but only if you are going to bed.
 MARISHA: Yeah, see what you can find. Have I finished it? I haven't finished it.
 MATT: You haven't finished it yet, but a little over halfway.
 LIAM: Okay. I'm going to read it before bed. It will take me about an hour. Good night.
 LAURA: (cackles) I think he was bragging at you. Good night, Caleb!
 MARISHA: I'll give it to him, it's fine. He needs a little self confidence, a little encouragement?
 MATT: Okay, you go read it. Nott, what are you doing?
 SAM: I feel the urge to go sneak into a room.
 TRAVIS: It's just an open door with a bunch of buttons and a flask in it.
 SAM: It's not even locked?
 MATT: No.
 SAM: Oh, well, I'll push it open and look inside. What do I see?
 MATT: It's empty, it's dark, except for you see this-- Actually, make a-- Let me check one thing on this. Just to see how this works in this circumstance.
 MARISHA: Lot of great shirts in the store. Great shirts.
 MATT: Make an investigation check.
 SAM: I mean, what is this? What is this roll?
 LAURA: That is majorly cocked.
 SAM: Okay, good.
 SAM and LAURA: (groan)
 LAURA: You should have taken the cocked.
 SAM: Seven.
 MATT: There you see a shining bag of glittering coin and buttons spilling out of the top of this small satchel.
 SAM: Why would this even be here? And a flask on top? Wow! Do I see Fjord's belongings over near his bed?
 MATT: Yes, you do.
 SAM: I'm going over there.
 TRAVIS: As soon as she comes in the door, the door slams shut. Molly, get the window!
 TALIESIN: Right!
 SAM: I draw my hand crossbow!
 TRAVIS: Nott--
 SAM: Are you an imposter?!
 TRAVIS: No. We are going to have a talk. Don't try any funny business. Why are you trying to sneak through our stuff?
 SAM: I would never do that to a friend!
 TRAVIS: Molly told me! Molly told me you were in here rifling through my stuff.
 SAM: I was hungry. There's a definite explanation for this.
 TRAVIS: What were you looking for?
 SAM: Seafood. You must have some on you; you're of the sea. I love shrimp, and I never get a chance to get any, we're so landlocked in here. I love the taste of the sea!
 TRAVIS: Do I believe her?
 MATT: You can go ahead and make an insight check.
 TRAVIS: Natural 20.
 SAM: I was not looking for shrimp.
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: Nott, dear? Why don't you tell the nice man the truth? Devil's Tongue.
 SAM: Oh! What is that? What does that do? What is that?
 MATT: I need you to make a wisdom saving throw.
 TRAVIS: That's why I brought you in here.
 SAM: Wisdom? Ten.
 MATT: You are charmed by Mollymauk.
 SAM: What does that mean?
 MATT: Meaning, you're very friendly and amiable, and take his advice and suggestions like a very dear friend.
 TALIESIN: Probably should just tell him what you were really looking for.
 SAM: I was looking for your letter to the Soltryce Academy.
 TRAVIS: My letter? But, Nott, why?
 SAM: (whispering) I want it.
 TALIESIN: What for? It's fine, no one's in trouble.
 SAM: I want to give it to Caleb.
 TRAVIS: Well, why? What would Caleb do with it?
 SAM: What you would do with it. Study, learn magic, become more powerful.
 TRAVIS: You wouldn't want me to have that sort of ability, you'd rather Caleb have it?
 SAM: I don't know a lot about magic, but I know he has the potential to be very powerful.
 TRAVIS: You do?
 SAM: And I need him to be.
 TRAVIS: Why, Nott? Why do you need him to be powerful?
 SAM: So he can save me.
 TALIESIN: I mean, we can help save you, that's what friends do. Any of us who get more powerful can help you.
 TRAVIS: Nott, what do you need to be saved from?
 SAM: (sighs) So much. So much. But mainly, there's a lot of dangers in the world, and a lot of dangers for me, and especially the closer we get to the north? I think? They don't like me up there. He can protect me.
 TALIESIN: I think we can all do that.
 TRAVIS: Absolutely.
 SAM: No. No, you can't.
 TRAVIS: (clears throat) Nott, I hope you will learn to trust us and rely on us like you do Caleb. We may not be as powerful as he is, or has the ability to become, but certainly we can help you. Are you worried about something or someone in particular finding you?
 SAM: Maybe. Yes, there's a few people that I'm worried about, but no one specific where we're going. I know that people are always trying to get me, and (stammering) I wish-- I need his magic to be there for me when I need safety. I need him. I need him to live.
 TRAVIS: I understand. I'm sorry if we've upset you.
 SAM: No, you're cool for some reason right now.
 TALIESIN: We're all friends.
 TRAVIS: Not for some reason, I'm just cool in general, Nott. *I'm just cool in general, Nott.*
 SAM: So cool.
 TRAVIS: This shit is amazing.
 TALIESIN: It's not going to last, you do know that. It's not going to last.
 TRAVIS: Just for now, though.
 TALIESIN: Well, enjoy it while you have it.
 TRAVIS: Promise me that you will not go through my things anymore when I'm not around, and that the items that I have belong to me?
 SAM: Will you give me the letter? I could change your name on it to his name, and then he could use it to get into the school, and he could learn more powerful magic and then he could change me.
 TRAVIS: Change you?
 SAM: He could change this.
 TRAVIS: (clears throat) I understand. I know what it feels like to be ashamed or worried about what you look like. I do.
 SAM: But you're pretty handsome for a half-monster thing. (whispering) I think Jester likes you.
 TRAVIS: You think so?
 SAM: Yeah.
 TRAVIS: Well, I didn't always look like this.
 SAM: What?
 TRAVIS: I wasn't always a handsome half-monster thing.
 SAM: What did you use to be?
 TRAVIS: A kid, just like anyone else.
 SAM: Still a monster thing, though.
 TRAVIS: Yeah.
 SAM: Oh. Just a less handsome one.
 TRAVIS: Yeah. Stumpy, short. Big teeth.
 SAM: Were you a fat kid?
 TRAVIS: Little bit. Just sort of mis-proportioned. Listen, if we get to the--
 SAM: Do you have any pictures or--?
 (laughter)
 TRAVIS: If my MySpace is still up, you could see them. Goes back a tick.
 SAM: Did you ever have braces or anything?
 TRAVIS: Nope. No, I did my own dental work. Listen, if we get to the Soltryce Academy and that letter doesn't do me any good, I promise, you could have it and we'll make sure Caleb has a shot.
 SAM: Will you promise to keep Caleb alive?
 TRAVIS: Most definitely.
 TALIESIN: We're going to try and keep both of you alive.
 SAM: All right.
 TRAVIS: You look out for us, we'll look out for you.
 SAM: Can I ask you one favor?
 TRAVIS: You cannot have my stuff.
 SAM: All right. Never mind.
 TALIESIN: Remember, Nott, that next time you try and do this and if that letter goes missing again, I can do this to you again. I give her just enough of a knock on the head to break the spell.
 MATT: Okay.
 TRAVIS: Okay, easy! Easy! Open up the door! I open the door and I slowly open it up like trying to funnel a rat out of the room. Here you go. Remember what we talked about.
 SAM: I reach for the flask. Fuck!
 (laughter)
 TRAVIS: I stick my foot out right when she runs by.
 MATT: Oh, man. Make an acrobatics check.
 TRAVIS: You should be fine.
 SAM: Acrobatics check? 12.
 MATT: 12? That's enough. As you're darting through, you see the foot go out, and you leap, tumble, roll and make your way into the hallway and escape back to your chambers.
 TRAVIS: Man, that was more than I thought.
 TALIESIN: That was very interesting.
 TRAVIS: What do you make of all that?
 TALIESIN: Oh, I don't know. People are strange. Anyone who looks like us, you collect a few interesting enemies on the way, even at her age.
 TRAVIS: Are you praying over your swords tonight?
 TALIESIN: Of course. Every night.
 TRAVIS: All right. Can I join you?
 TALIESIN: Sure.
 TRAVIS: Great.
 LIAM: Come on, I'm just putting up the thread, come to bed. Come to bed.
 SAM: Do you trust Fjord and Molly?
 LIAM: No. No, I don't.
 SAM: Me neither.
 LIAM: (poof) Alarm.
 LAURA: And then Oskar falls in love with her! And he carries her across a field, and they love each other so much!
 MARISHA: That’s so great.
 LAURA: It's the most beautiful story, Beau!
 MARISHA: Can we go to sleep, now?
 LAURA: Yeah.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, the hard turn!
 MATT: You guys all eventually find yourselves to rest for the evening, awaking in the early morning. The chilled morning air comes through. The sky: still mostly gray, with patches of blue that poke through. No rain, it's still a little chilled. There's a bit of fog burning off by the time you awaken and look out your room's window. The morning is yours, what do you wish to do?
 LIAM: I go to Jester and Beauregard's room and say--
 LAURA: (sultrily) Oh, you're back again already, Caleb.
 LIAM: Good morning, sleepy heads! I leave the book leaning against the door.
 TRAVIS: Killed it in one night. Damn.
 MATT: All righty. The rest of you gather--
 TRAVIS: Yep. Downstairs.
 MATT: You have your morning breakfast.
 MARISHA: Did you find anything good in this?
 LIAM: Did I find anything good in it?
 MATT: More reinforcing more of what was there. Because a lot of the information about Xhorhasian society is still largely unknown or uncatalogued, you get the sense the more you read, and the more the perspectives of this assassin's left across the way, you're uncertain as to how accurate any of it is-- but it talks of a torturous society of bloodshed and beasts, a-- I got an eyelash in my eye, that's great.
 TRAVIS: Oh, that's the worst.
 MATT: There we go. Okay, we're good. Talking of this terrible life of endless wastes of carnivorous and cannibalistic creatures and that the Crick nation being this terrible place of perpetual inner turmoil, and vying for the next position of power. The assassin that falls into this relationship falls into it as perspective of being saved, of being taken from this terrible place and brought into the good graces of this General, and brought into the comforting realm of the Empire. However, upon being discovered, ends up being captured, tried, and killed. The last part of the book deals with the General going through his own grief and the process, but also understanding it never could be, and was probably for the best. You're left with a unsatisfied meh feeling at the end of it all. 
 TRAVIS: Would you call it a blue balls feeling?
 MATT: Kind of.
 LIAM: There was a lot more historical fiction in it than actual pornographic content, I was surprised. 
 MARISHA: It doesn't really ultimately matter, but I feel like that was like a toxic relationship. I didn't really feel like the assassin and Theo should have-- I mean, he led to her death. That kind of sucks.
 LIAM: Feels like it's weighing on you. It's amazing what a good book can do, it gets its grips into you.
 SAM: Are we a book club now?
 TRAVIS: Morning, Nott.
 SAM: Yeah, morning.
 LAURA: What's wrong? Did you guys get into a fight?
 TALIESIN: Nott is just upset because she was trying to do a little reading last night as well.
 MARISHA: Did you get a book?
 SAM: Not exactly. 
 LAURA: Here, Nott. You can read this now.
 SAM: Which is this one?
 LAURA: That's the Tusk Love.
 SAM: All right!
 (laughter)
 TRAVIS: So we set out our plan. Sewers. Make ourselves look like poor folk. Make our way into the Tri-Spire. 
 LAURA: Not poor folk, rich folk.
 SAM: Oh wait, no, but we're seeking help of the Richter.
 LAURA: It doesn't matter, we can't be poor folk in the Tri-Spire. We need to be rich folk that need help from the Richter.
 SAM: Okay, that's fine.
 LIAM: Yeah, because if we come out looking like rats, then out we will go.
 SAM: Upper middle class? Lower middle class?
 TRAVIS: Upper middle.
 LAURA: Very high middle if not low upper.
 TRAVIS: Medium well?
 SAM: We're a family that is down on our luck, because--?
 LAURA: Like a warm, pink center.
 SAM: What's our cover story? What's the ruse here? We need help from the government because bandits have taken over our house?
 LAURA: Yes! Oh! Yes, how about we have a trading company! How about some of our wares got stolen on the road on the way to Zadash by a group of bandits?
 SAM: Oh! We know things, why don't we pose as like Trostenwald brewers or something and our brew shipment-- I'm spitballing-- got stolen by someone and we need help to get it back!
 TRAVIS: Do we know if the High-Richters normally rule on or govern over?
 LIAM: Yeah, I was going to ask if the two empire kids know about that position.
 MATT: You know that the High-Richter is the associate judge to the Lawmaster. The Lawmaster oversees very high profile judgments, and then anything that falls below anything high-profile.
 MARISHA: Circuit judge.
 MATT: Circuit judge, is what the High-Richter is. Things go through the High-Richter first before they go to the Lawmaster. They gauge what is important enough for the Lawmaster and what remains in their circle, which is why you can see the frustration with anything that they try to bring forth that may have been incriminating to an ally of the High-Richter could be easily caught in that net and not brought upward. 
 MARISHA: I have this inventory sheet that I got from the Baumbauchs, we could use this as claims that it got stolen. And hope for reimbursement.
 SAM: Stolen by someone in the government?
 TRAVIS: Or stolen by the Baumbauchs? I mean, if we do something that a family within the Tri-Spire needed representation, the law upheld, but the Richter turned an eye because a more powerful family was winning out, then that person is shit.
 MARISHA: This is like an order invoice that I have, right?
 MATT: The order ledger or you mean the letter?
 MARISHA: No, the order ledger.
 TRAVIS: From the brewery, that we took in session zero.
 MATT: Right, you're not talking about the letter from Baumbauch from the Gentleman, right?
 MARISHA: No, but in that I have an order ledger?
 MATT: Yes, there is.
 MARISHA: So we could claim that he never paid due and we are looking for some sort of representation to try and get our money from the Baumbauchs?
 LAURA: I have a forgery kit, you guys!
 SAM: What are we forging?
 TRAVIS: I don't know if he would hold sway, but if he doesn't pursue justice, for someone of the Tri-Spire, that should tell us enough. The Baumbauchs are very influential and powerful.
 LIAM: Yes, that's true.
 LAURA: We could change the name of the Baumbauchs to something else.
 SAM: We could be the Baumbauchs.
 TRAVIS: What do you think, Molly?
 TALIESIN: I honestly don't understand any of this.
 MARISHA: Does it say on the ledger the company that it came from? Does it say like from Dryer Supply and Co.?
 TALIESIN: What accent was that?
 LAURA: Dwarven.
 MARISHA: Me! Me being an asshole.
 MATT: The Timalt Store House.
 MARISHA: The Timalt Store House.
 MATT: Correct. 
 TRAVIS: Doesn't Timalt make hardware?
 MARISHA: So it can be from the Timalts.
 SAM: The Baumbauchs stole our stuff?
 MARISHA: They never paid due on the order that we sent them.
 SAM: Do we even know the Baumbauchs are here?
 MARISHA: No, they're in Trostenwald.
 SAM: Why would we be claiming something here? We need to be claiming from a family that's here.
 MARISHA: Timalt is from here, right?
 MATT: Timalts are in Zadash.
 MARISHA: They are in Zadash. They made a shipment.
 TRAVIS: If the High-Richter doesn't say, "You're right, this is injustice, let's take it to the Lawmaster," then that Richter sucks.
 LIAM: She could be a lazy ass.
 MARISHA: Regardless, it's just a story so we can get a beat on her, right?
 LIAM: Sure.
 LAURA: What if we say, "We're from the Timalt Company, they never paid our invoice, and they stole our puppies!"
 MARISHA: That's not bad.
 TRAVIS: Puppy crime.
 LAURA: That's how we would know that it was a bad guy. Okay.
 TRAVIS: So they stole from our invoice and they took all our Saint Bernard puppies.
 LAURA: Yes, and it is very sad.
 TRAVIS: Okay.
 MARISHA: What time is it?
 MATT: It's mid-morning. 10:00.
 TRAVIS: What time, exactly, of the day?
 MATT: 10:13am.
 LIAM: Caleb said.
 MARISHA: Is it early enough to where, on my way there, I can pick up my custom coat?
 MATT: Yeah, you can do that.
 MARISHA: Okay.
 TALIESIN: Especially since it just rained, so the sewer will be really damp.
 TRAVIS: Oh, god!
 MARISHA: Are we trying to go through the sewer?
 TRAVIS: Yeah, we have to.
 LAURA: To get all of us through.
 TRAVIS: Well, let's pick up your cloak and make our way.
 TALIESIN: Do we still have the writ, or is the writ gone?
 MATT: The writ was retrieved.
 TALIESIN: Never mind, that's fine.
 MARISHA: We can still find the back sewer entrance, have Nott pop the lock, and we know how to go.
 TRAVIS: Why didn't we try to forge a writ, damn it?
 LAURA: Who all can make disguises for themselves?
 TALIESIN: Oh! I can figure it out.
 MARISHA: With my coat, kind of-ish?
 LAURA: You can cover up your face, at least.
 MATT: Mmkay, so you guys make your way back to the same sewer entrance where you originally embarked below. There are two crownsguard in the vicinity, they're keeping watch of that intersection, just like they were last time. They haven't noticed your approach yet, but they are keeping an eye.
 MARISHA: We're going to have to distract them.
 TRAVIS: I could have one of them beat the shit out of the other one.
 TALIESIN: Oh!
 LAURA: Why?
 TRAVIS: Let's do that. I cast Crown of Madness on one of the guards.
 TALIESIN: That's not going to go poorly.
 MARISHA: Yes! So into this!
 MATT: Okay!
 TRAVIS: Hopefully from an area where they don't see me casting it.
 MATT: Make a stealth check.
 TRAVIS: Oh no! 
 LAURA: Blessing of the Trickster! Advantage!
 TRAVIS: 14! Oh, I have advantage? None.
 TALIESIN: 14!
 MATT: As you hide off on the side, you focus and then concentrate on one of the two crownsguard. As the magic begins to slowly filter around the outside of the face, the brief little motes of shadow begin to be plucked from the space and gather around the outside of its head. Unknowingly-- what's your spell DC? That's a ten. It's higher than ten, I'm pretty sure.
 TRAVIS: Yes, it is! 14.
 MATT: All of the sudden, the guard (grunts) and you watch as these motes fit faintly around the outside, like this floating crown on the top of the head. You force him to attack the other?
 TRAVIS: Kick his ass, sea bass.
 MATT: The guard (grunts) grabs his blade, runs forward. The other guard is like, "Hey, what-- oh!" (screams) Pulls his shield up. "What's going on?! David, what the fuck are you doing?!"
 TRAVIS: Nott! Quick, let the lock on the sewer thing, let's go!
 SAM: Oh, I'm doing something?
 LAURA: No, we don't have to, it's not locked.
 SAM: What are we doing?
 TRAVIS: I thought it was locked!
 LIAM: Let's find out!
 MATT: It's going to make another save. It's a two, it's still holding.
 MARISHA: Is the sewer locked?
 MATT: The gate? It is locked. 
 SAM: Okay, then I'll pick it!
 MATT: Everyone's attention right now is directly on this as one crownsguard is attacking the other.
 SAM: What am I doing?
 MATT: It's plus six. 
 SAM: Seven. No, nine.
 MATT: Nine. It's not coming off, it's not opening!
 SAM: Break it!
 MATT: He attacks the other guard, he's screaming, "Get help!" No, it's an 11. What's your spell DC?
 TRAVIS: 14!
 LAURA: I try to break the gate, I try to pull the gate! I'm trying to pull it open.
 MATT: Make a strength check. Roll a d20, add your strength modifier.
 LAURA: Oh, 17!
 MATT: (ping) You actually break it with your nare hands, leaving an opening.
 LAURA: Go, go, go!
 TRAVIS: Everybody in!
 MATT: There's a scream starting to happen, you guys start running in, one after another. Guard gets one more saving throw. 13, what's your--?
 TRAVIS: 14!
 MATT: 14?! Shit! The other guard is now wrestling him to the ground, and he's trying to hold him to the ground. "What is fuck?!" You hear screams going off around now this ruckus is gathering in the center as people are starting to yell. You can hear in the distance other crownsguard yelling and starting to gather in the middle of this chaos as you all get down in the sewer, and pull it shut.
 MARISHA: That was awesome!
 TRAVIS: Yeah, I might've fucked that thing up. 
 LAURA: Keep going!
 LIAM: We're going to be quiet in the sewers because there's things down here.
 LAURA: Oh yeah, avoid all the rat balloons!
 LIAM: They were everywhere the last time.
 MATT: You hear all the ruckus up there, echoing down inside and other footsteps coming through and you hear this guy going, "I am so sorry, I don't know what was happening! Ow, that hurts! I don't know what's--" and you hear he's being held to the ground now, and people are shouting and, oh man. 
 MARISHA: Ooh, that guy is definitely arrested.
 MATT: That guy’s going to have a bad day! 
 TRAVIS: He might get demoted, a couple day's pay. 
 LIAM: He is going to be about 12 inches shorter.
 TRAVIS: No, come on!
 MATT: Go ahead and make a stealth check, guys.
 LAURA: You still have the blessing. Does anybody else need a blessing?
 MARISHA: We're all rolling stealth?
 TRAVIS: Ten.
 TALIESIN: Ten.
 LAURA: Seven.
 SAM: 22. 
 LIAM: 20.
 MARISHA: 22.
 MATT: Okay. At a mass majority, you do slip around the same area where you had the original confrontation, you do see some more of those rats scattered about, but you manage to quickly dart by. In a few moments, you hear a (hiss) turn as they notice something, but they go in the direction, as you go in to move past. Some of them shift in where you were but no longer where you are. The blind rats are going by the sound and being misled a bit, so you manage to maneuver around without any immediate conflict. Eventually, you make your way back to where those webs were situated before the phase spider's little domain there at the edge. Still, Thed is untouched from where you left it. You head back to the rung and you can see the entranceway into the Tri-Spire District.
 TRAVIS: Did not think about what to do once we got into this part of the plan.
 SAM: We need to disguise ourselves. 
 TRAVIS: Right, yeah.
 SAM: Then we go up there and then find out where the Richter lives and then pitch our really ill-thought out plan to them. This is going to be great.
 TRAVIS: Yeah! I cast Disguise Self. Very long black cloak with gold trim, like a nice trim goatee and slicked back jet black hair. Piercing blue eyes, nice looking human.
 MARISHA: Can I take the brown side of my newly purchased reversible coat, take out my Brewer's Kit that I have, and take a few of the bottles and fashion them to my waist a little bit?
 SAM: Disguise Self. Same exact thing as Fjord, except longer hair, shorter mustache. 
 MATT: Perfect! 
 TRAVIS: Cloak, gold trim?
 SAM: Yeah, everything. Shorter, but female, just a little outline for the mustache. 
 MATT: You're like the pallbearer to the undertaker of Fjord.
 TRAVIS: Great analogy! 
 MATT: Thank you! Anybody else making any effort or are you just doing your thing?
 LAURA: I'm going to cast Disguise Self and I'm going to be tan, short, elven woman in a royal blue lace dress, very similar to the one the lady was wearing, with the cut out. And soft medium hair, pulled back in waves.
 TALIESIN: I'm going to put the hood up and stay in the back.
 MATT: Okay.
 LIAM: I make myself look like the male version of the elven woman that Jester did in a similar high collared clothing.
 MATT: Perfect. This is great.
 TRAVIS: Fated to do well.
 SAM: We're a normal family!
 MATT: The moment you climb up the top-- did you leave it locked? Did you lock it behind you as you--
 SAM: I don't know, you tell me.
 LAURA: No, we didn't. I don't think we did.
 MATT: I think you left it unlocked. It wouldn't have been a huge issue. You're not in danger. We'll say you left it unlocked because you intended to possibly use it again in the future. You head back, push the two pipes, and you all climb back into the alleyway. You are now in the Tri-Spire district. 
 MARISHA: Awesome. Okay, let's ask around and find where this Richter lives. 
 MATT: Walking around the city, you see a few crownsguard wandering the streets, they occasionally put a glance to not recognize you wandering, but don't pay immediate attention. You do see one gentleman, early 60s or so, who's wearing this nice frilled shirt with heavy brass buttons down the front with this potbelly that's tucked in with a belt, breeches that go past the knee before his boots hit, and he's walking in the street, strutting a bit, looking up. He's the first person you see that crosses your path that looks like they probably know the vicinity.
 SAM: Want me to go talk to him?
 TRAVIS: Hello sir, excuse me.
 MATT: "Yes, can I help you?"
 TRAVIS: I'm sorry to bother you, we have business with the High-Richter. Is there a chance that you could point us in his direction-- her direction.
 MATT: "Well, that is the High-Richter's estate. I do not know if she is home. She may be at the King's Hall.
 TRAVIS: I really don't care, we're just delivering a parcel.
 MATT: "Very well. Let's see. Dayana's estate is right around that way." He points. You see that he has this thin, white John Waters mustache across the top that turns into this light goatee right at the tip of the chin. As he points over, you can see, "Right on the outskirts of the Gilded Willows-- that one." He points again. 
 TRAVIS: Wonderful, thank you for your time. 
 MATT: "It was my pleasure." He continues walking on his way. 
 LAURA: I walk like him. 
 TRAVIS: Nott, your mustache is much nicer.
 SAM: Thank you, honey. 
 TRAVIS: Do you know what a mime is? You just mime this mission. 
 SAM: Okay. There's a fierce wind, I've got to it! Oh no! I'm in a box! Oh no! The box is getting smaller! Don't worry, I'll climb out! 
 LIAM: Nott, what Fjord is implying is-- you know how I can make myself look like anything?
 SAM: I'm not an idiot!
 (laughter)
 LIAM: Okay.
 MATT: Approaching the homestead that was pointed out by that gentleman earlier, the homestead is surrounded by a seven-foot tall stone and mortar wall that tightly crowds the perimeter. This is only maybe a three-foot space between the wall and the actual home. You see that the two-story home is painted in a forest green color on the outside of the wooden stone built structure. You can see that there is a front archway to the door that goes beyond the wall. There is a small gate. Beyond that, there is the front door to the estate where there is a stationed crownsguard. 
 LAURA: This looks really well fortified. 
 SAM: We're just going to walk up and ask for--
 TRAVIS: Ask for an audience, yeah. Maybe if we say that we were sent by the Lawmaster, for the High-Richter to make a ruling.
 SAM: Should we leave anyone out to be ready to help if anything goes wrong?
 TRAVIS: Good instinct, what do you think? 
 SAM: I don't know. Caleb, what do you think?
 LIAM: Well, you're always good to have hidden away n case something goes squirrely. So definitely you. Maybe me as well. 
 SAM: Maybe.
 LIAM: Yeah. 
 TRAVIS: Jester, I'd like you to come.
 LAURA: I want to come. (with an accent) I want to come.
 TRAVIS: Nice. Molly, what do you want to do?
 TALIESIN: I think I am a very reasonable personal assistant to anyone who is trying to make a deal. 
 TRAVIS: Indeed. What would your name be in this situation? 
 TALIESIN: Do we have to have names? 
 TRAVIS: I'm just trying to think ahead. 
 TALIESIN: Well, fine. Erikson.
 TRAVIS: Lovely.
 MARISHA: Lawrence is great. Worked for me before.
 TRAVIS: Lawrence?
 MARISHA: Actually, no. Let's do something else, considering I already used Lawrence once.
 SAM: It's just a fucking name, pick anything! Sorry.
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: Do you need a drink?
 SAM: Yes, I do. I had a terrible night last night.
 LAURA: How about Marge?
 MARISHA: Francis. Francis Titmalt-- Timalt, not Titmalt.
 TRAVIS: Are you staying out here with Nott, Caleb, or are you going to come in? If we make it in.
 LIAM: If you make it in? No, I'm going to stay with Nott. I will be back-up. You're a good talker. We don't need two good talkers.
 SAM: What about the cat?
 LIAM: Yeah. Oh, cat?
 SAM: How will we know what's going on inside?
 LAURA: They don't like cats here in the Tri-Spire.
 LIAM: I think that we're hidden away in case things go bad with the crownsguard. After that then they're on their own, I think.
 TRAVIS: That's right. Wish us luck.
 MARISHA: Let's go.
 TRAVIS: I walk up to one of the two crownsguard outside the door.
 LAURA: I follow behind him.
 MARISHA: Super official.
 LIAM: Be careful, twinnie.
 MATT: There is actually only one crownsguard at the front door, behind the gate. As you approach, arms crossed--
 TRAVIS: “Yes, please, look lively, unfortunately we've been sent here from the Lawmaster, we have some very urgent business with High-Richter Prucine. Please, if you wouldn't mind, would you fetch her?”
 MATT: Make a deception check.
 TRAVIS: Natural 20.
 MATT: Glad you fixed that. The guard goes, "Oh, I-- Just a second," goes and opens the door, leaning inside. "High-Richter, you have guests out front." A voice goes, "Tell them to wait a moment."
 LAURA: I like her already.
 MATT: A moment passes. The crownsguard steps out of the way and you see emerge from the doorway an older female half-elf with dark red-purple hair that is short on the sides and brushed to one side, almost to a point. She has a gaunt, angular appearance, and is in the process of putting on ceremonial gold and white armor, similar to what you had seen on the Herald of the Hall, but a more elaborate design, and taken from the process of buckling together a brace. She walks up and goes, "All right, now who's here for the time with me?"
 TRAVIS: Oh, High-Richter, it's so lovely to see you again. I know it's been quite a while.
 MATT: "I have no idea who you are."
 TRAVIS: Bradley. We met-- must have been years ago now. You remember the Gala.
 MARISHA: I think it was a fundraiser, last time you were up for election?
 MATT: Make a deception check.
 TRAVIS: Yeah! 14 plus four, 18.
 MATT: "Yes, of course, I recall. It's been some time. What brings you to the front of my homestead in the middle of the day? I'm on my way to the Hall.
 TRAVIS: I understand. A bit of terrible business, actually. Our family has been unfortunately at the poor end of some corporate espionage, and I'm afraid the Baumbauchs, isn't that who they are in Trostenwald?
 LAURA: Terrible evil, the Baumbauchs.
 MARISHA: Especially that Demedan.
 TRAVIS: Just a wretched fellow. They've made off with quite a bit of our product, and we have some evidence against them. We tried to take it to the Lawmaster, of course, we didn't want to trouble you, but--
 MARISHA: She directed us here, we thought, well, Dayana is just so sweet, she would of course help us out.
 TRAVIS: Absolutely.
 MARISHA: Here is the invoice from the amount due that they have not paid from the Timalt Store House.
 TRAVIS: I'm sure justice will be swift, but unfortunately, much of our family's finances are wrapped up in this.
 LAURA: They took our puppies.
 MATT: I would like both of you to make deception checks, please.
 LIAM: Caleb is turning the diamond over and over in his hand like a fidget spinner, watching all of this.
 TRAVIS: At least you have the diamond, right?
 MARISHA: Oh my god, what should I roll? Give me something good. That's not too bad. 15.
 LAURA: Six.
 MATT: She goes, "Puppies, I'm sure. Well, Baumbauch is outside of the Zadash jurisdiction. That is Trostenwald territory. I’m afraid that is not something I would nor could handle if I wanted to. If you wish to bring them to justice either present your evidence to the lawmaster of Trostenwald, or bring Baumbauch to me. Otherwise, I have no interest.”
 TRAVIS: I’m sure you can understand our situation. We have already done that exact thing! We wouldn’t waste your time with such rudimentary worries, but–
 MATT: “Then why are you wasting my time right now?”
 TRAVIS: Well, frankly, the Lawmaster in Trostenwald seemed to show you very little respect when we mentioned your name, and being that our family is so influential around here, we’re going to be tossed to the wayside if justice isn’t found. Surely you understand that.
 MARISHA: And, of course, we would happily pay you for any type of additional service you might be able to help us out with.
 MATT: “Am I– Step inside.” The crown’s guard step inside and close the door behind. “Am I to understand that you’ve come out here in broad daylight to my estate in an attempt to bribe the High-Richter of Zadash?”
 TRAVIS: Was that what you said?
 MARISHA: No, I don’t think those were my words at all. No.
 TRAVIS: It was merely a few pennies for your time.
 LAURA: A favor for a favor!
 TRAVIS: Yes, I mean certainly if you feel like doing justice on its own– I would like to see people taken care of that take care of us.
 MATT: “So long as it’s not a bribe. Favors we can do.”
 TRAVIS: Well, of course!
 MATT: “I’ll see what’s possible. I’ll ask around. I’ll take these documents, if you don’t mind, to see what can be mustered.”
 MARISHA: And, of course, we are always willing to pay in favors. 
 MATT: “Of course. There are all sides and types of favors that can be helpful to the Crown and those below.”
 LAURA: Also, what do you think of puppies?
 MATT: “I think they’re droll and must be fed to their larger kin. So are we done here?”
 TRAVIS: Yes, I believe we are. Thank you for your time. We’re most gracious.
 MATT: “I’m certain it has been.”
 MARISHA: While he wraps it up, can I do a quick glance over her table or over her desk to see if I see any type of papers? 
 MATT: Well, this is on the front doorstep.
 MARISHA: Oh, I thought she pulled us inside. I’m sorry.
 MATT: No, she pulled the crownsguard inside.
 TRAVIS: But since we’re inside of that seven-foot wall: windows, doors, security measures, how many floors?
 MATT: From the immediate front position, there is the door itself beyond the archway, two small windows to each side of it, though it appears that they’re closed, and they’re bisected with wooden beams between.
 TRAVIS: Shuttered? Wooden shuttered closed?
 MATT: They are shuttered, yeah, from the inside. You’d open them from the inside to bring in the light, but they’re currently closed. The second floor above you do see on balcony. It’s a bit receded and there’s a balcony that looks out over it all with a second set of doors, but that is currently closed.
 MARISHA: Okay.
 TALIESIN: While we’re bowing on our way out, I’m going to drop my waterskin and spill it. 
 MATT: Okay.
 LAURA: Erikson!
 TALIESIN: Oh! I’m so sorry, my lord.
 LAURA: Every time! Every time!
 TALIESIN: As I’m cleaning it up, I’m going to make eye contact just briefly. What do I see? I was curious what the reaction to this ridiculous creature is spilling shit all over her front lawn. That’s all.
 MATT: Oh, I got you. I follow you now.
 TALIESIN: Yeah.
 MATT: There is an immediate bit of a scowl and, “I would also ask nicely if you’ll stop bringing these demon bloods onto my estate to be ruining--“
 MARISHA: That’s what we were looking for this whole time.
 LAURA: Like the puppy thing wasn’t enough? Come on! 
 TRAVIS: I mean, they’re kicking cats in this bitch, so it’s not that far off.
 TALIESIN: A thousand apologies, my lord, I’ll take your sister and make sure she gets her medicine.
 TRAVIS: You embarrass me!
 LAURA: How dare you, Erickson!
 TRAVIS: Please make sure she’s beaten as you lead her away. I apologize for his fuddy-duddyness.
 MARISHA: It’s hard to find good help these days.
 TRAVIS: Thank you for your time. Good day.
 MATT: She turns around wordlessly and goes inside and slams the door.
 MARISHA: Go, guys. Let’s go.
 TALIESIN: There’s easy ways to find out if people are terrible or not.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, that was good. Well, we walk a fair distance away from the crownsguard and we see Caleb and little pallbearer.
 SAM: Did, they-- oh. Hi, honey!
 TRAVIS: Like a small Morticia Addams.
 LAURA: With a mustache. 
 LIAM: So we've got it buttoned down. 
 SAM: Did she offer to kill a bunch of innocents or anything?
 TRAVIS: Well, I mean she said that dogs should be fed to the larger ones. 
 LAURA: And she said that tieflings were terrible. 
 SAM: Okay, devil's advocate, here: I really don't like dogs either.
 LAURA: Yeah, but puppies, Nott, puppies.
 SAM: Yeah, they make great food. 
 LAURA: Nott!
 SAM: When you're out in the woods and that's all that you have to eat, they have very tender meat! And, to be fair, (whispering) Mollymauk is a little bit of, I mean, I wouldn't trust him either.
 TRAVIS: Right, but imagine if she had gotten her eyes on you. I mean, don't know what she would have done. 
 SAM: Well, that would make her the same as 95 percent of people in this city. 
 TRAVIS: But that means she's got to die. 
 SAM: Okay, that’s true.
 LIAM: We are not going bring this woman's life down in a shambles because she is an asshole, I mean, we are assholes. Yeah? For different reasons. 
 MARISHA: But we're assholes without power, though. 
 LIAM: Okay. And?
 MARISHA: I don't know, it's less dangerous? I don't know. 
 MATT: As you guys are having this conversation, you notice that the streets themselves have long silken streamers that are affixed from light pole to light pole as part of the decoration along the streets, but you see additional decorations being put up. You see bunches of flowers being affixed to the top of these poles, you can see more streamers of multiple colors being placed around a center courtyard, in one of the mid-areas of the Silken Terrace. 
 TALIESIN: Must be some sort of harvest theme that everything is going up. 
 LAURA: Yes. 
 MARISHA: It's that harvest fest. Remember, there's another tournament and stuff that we can enter into. 
 TRAVIS: Is it just the Tri-Spire, or is it everywhere?
 MATT: Right now, it's just being put around the Gilded Willows, which is a little ways further away from the estate as you're heading back. You can see decorations going up, tables being set, it looks to be a small platform being risen. There's some sort of event coming up fairly soon. 
 TALIESIN: I'm perfectly content making snap judgements of people, I've been doing it all my life and it's very rarely steered me wrong, and in another time and another place, I'd be more than happy to run something. 
 LIAM: Okay, so let me go over this, then. We have no form of payment of any kind planned in advance. We don't know if this woman has done anything besides being a snide puppy-hater. 
 LAURA: She takes bribes. She's a corrupt politician.
 LIAM: I have personally bribed people, I don't know that I would-- Listen, I do not like the government, I say this quietly, I do not like the empire, but we're really sticking our neck out with very dangerous people. I don't think we have much to go on, I don't think we know how we’re going to be receiving recompense for this. 
 TALIESIN: There is going to have to be some coin, of course. 
 TRAVIS: Certainly, your fears are founded. If there's not enough pay, than obviously it's not worth the risk. But I have to say, that even after meeting them for the second time, I feel like these people, they're good folks. I think they just want to see their city bettered. Honestly, that Dolan fellow I think would do better in a seat of power than this current wench.
 LIAM: Well, I am willing to discuss our continued involvement, once the payment is figured out. 
 TRAVIS: I think that's fair. 
 MARISHA: I mean, look. People in power tend to get corrupt, they don't start corrupt. In my opinion, it doesn't matter who is sitting there, as long as we get paid from it, who cares?
 TRAVIS: And there's still many things to figure out. We have to look after this Lord Sutan. But first, we should see to that afternoon meeting, about the coin. We should address that straight out. 
 LAURA: I guess we have to leave the Tri-Spire then. 
 TRAVIS: Yeah, I guess we do. We're meeting them at the Song and Supper Inn.
 LAURA: What time?
 TRAVIS: Just after noon. 
 LAURA: Just *afternoon*? You didn't get an hour. 
 TRAVIS: I was not specific. 
 SAM: We don't have watches. 
 TALIESIN: 12:01. It's just after noon. 
 TRAVIS: Yeah. Don't make me say it. 
 LIAM: It's on all our minds. Unspoken. 
 TRAVIS: I'm trying not to. 
 TALIESIN: This place is giving me a rash. 
 MARISHA: Yeah, I guess let's head there, meet up with these guys. It's probably about that time, yeah?
 MATT: Yep. So you guys make your way, reversing your steps, outside of the Tri-Spire, making your way towards the western side of the Interstead Sprawl, to the Song and Supper Inn.
 LAURA: Before we leave, are there any benches around, just sitting?
 MATT: There are a few, yeah. 
 LAURA: I want to leave one of the pamphlets for the Traveler sitting on a bench. 
 MATT: Okay, you sneakily slip it into a small gap, so it's visible, but not liable to be blown away. Perfect. 
 LAURA: Minus one. 
 MATT: As you guys make your way to the interior of the inn, it is lively. It is the loudest, musically, tavern, you've seen. You get the sense, both by title, and by the interior, that this essentially a perpetual an open mic night for any musicians or bards who want to come and try out their craft. There are three different bands that are cycling through on the main, raised dais to perform. The atmosphere is lively, and folks come here for that. It's a poor tavern, comparatively. The interior looks like a lot of the paint is chipped and run or crinkled, the smell inside is not the best, but it serves basic food, basic drinks, and at least an atmosphere of music and fun. Some folks sing along, and jump into a shanty or two. As you come in, you can see both Ulog and Dolan are currently sitting at a table across from each other. As they notice you guys approach, they raise a drink, and you can see the rest of the table they have ready for you guys to come and sit. 
 LIAM: We have already dropped our disguises if they recognized us. 
 TRAVIS: It took us 45 minutes to walk here. 
 MATT: Your spells would have run out by now. 
 MARISHA: Before we walk into the place, I turn my coat inside out, back to the blue. 
 LAURA: Any guards in the tavern?
 MATT: Not in the tavern, no. There was one outside, but patrolling the streets. Not everything is super heavily guarded in smaller areas like this. 
 LAURA: Does it look like anybody is looking at us, anybody else in the tavern?
 MATT: Make a perception check.
 SAM: Nice!
 LAURA: Ooh! 22. 
 MATT: I mean, no more than anyone looks at you when you enter a room, being a blue-skinned tiefling. You don't get the sense that anyone is casing you the entire time that you've been there. 
 MARISHA: It doesn't look like anyone followed us in?
 MATT: You don't notice anybody following you in, no. 
 MARISHA: Okay. 
 MATT: You see Dolan and Ulog are there waiting at the table, as you come and join with them. Does everybody sit with them?
 TALIESIN: I'm going to sit at another table and listen in. 
 MARISHA: Fjord and I will go over. 
 TRAVIS: The rest of you are welcome. 
 SAM: You've met with them before, right?
 LIAM: Yeah. 
 SAM: So you could go over. 
 LIAM: I could, yeah.
 SAM: Let's go join them.
 TALIESIN: Really, oh fine. 
 LIAM: Well, it has to happen eventually. 
 TRAVIS: Molly, keep an eye on the room. 
 MATT: You go with to the table. Dolan gives you a look. "And this is one of your associates?"
 MARISHA: Is that a problem?
 MATT: "No, I'd just like to ask your name."
 LAURA: Tonya Fancybottom. Nice to meet you. 
 MATT: "Tonya? Pleasure. I'm Dolan, Dolan Thrym, this is Ulog." He sits there, he's like, "Hey." They both take a very long minute and look over you. 
 MARISHA: Hey friend. 
 MATT: "I'm sorry, I'm just being careful."
 LIAM: We're pretty ragtag, but they're both very good at what they do. 
 LAURA: I'm blue. 
 MATT: "I can see that."
 MARISHA: People like her make you uncomfortable?
 MATT: "No."
 MARISHA: You sure? What about people like him? People like him make you uncomfortable? 
 MATT: "I mean only in the sense that they're fresh faces."
 MARISHA: All right, just checking.
 TALIESIN: I’m giving a clear.
 MATT: Ulog leans in, he's like, "I've watched them a bit, they're all friends, it's fine." Dolan goes, "All right."
 TRAVIS: (whispers) We've got to look for that motherfucker more often.
 MARISHA: He's fucking everywhere. He's been following us a lot. You said he was shifty, a little criminal--
 MATT: Dolan goes, "All right, so, we've been looking for an opening, we've been trying to find out. We thought it was tonight, but they've pushed it back a day. There is a pre-harvest gala happening in the Tri-Spire tomorrow night. We figure this distraction would be enough to do any of the quiet infiltrations that we're attempting to accomplish, should you still be interested in coming with us. I know there was hesitation, and I don't want anyone to be coming into this that doesn't feel comfortable. To be honest, I want to be comfortable as well, and to know that we're going to bed with the right people. Are there any concerns? Any questions, worries?"
 TRAVIS: Sure. We did some casing of the High-Richter ourselves. She's not the most savory type. I believe some of my associates have a question of, well, the unsavory topic of payment.
 MATT: "Right. I assumed that was probably going to be a thing. Me and Horris pitched in together. We don't have much, but this is too important to not. Me and Horris put together about 115 gold between the two of us." He puts a small thing on the table, showing it. He's not putting it out in the open because he doesn't want to be like "I have all this money on the table!" He's like, "We have some. Kara put in 53 gold of her own. Ulog leans in and goes, "513 gold, 21 silver, 302 copper. It's my life savings. I want to see these fuckers burn."
 MARISHA: Wait. 500 from his personal stash?
 LIAM: Insight check on that statement.
 MATT: Make an insight check.
 LIAM: Balls. Total balls.
 MATT: Total balls? Hard to read.
 MARISHA: Just under 700.
 TRAVIS: That's about the same as the King's Hall, yeah.
 SAM: Caleb? This job doesn't involve monsters. That's pretty good.
 LIAM: Literally, no. Figuratively? Yes. The biggest and the baddest, potentially.
 LAURA: Would we be all going to this gala together?
 MATT: "We wouldn't be going to the gala. We would be--"
 MARISHA: Breaking in.
 TALIESIN: During the gala.
 LAURA: Oh, so no party.
 TALIESIN: Party after.
 MATT: "Party after."
 TRAVIS: Would anyone of your group like to be joining us? Kara or Ulog, yourself?
 MATT: Ulog, still leaning forward, goes, "I'd like to. I have the most at stake here, monetarily. I've got skills I think will synergize well with the ones you bring to the table. I'll be coming with you."
 TRAVIS: I tend to believe him just because we haven't seen him.
 LAURA: He's pretty stealthy.
 MATT: Dolan goes, "Kara, her skills are more in the interpersonal level, not so much infiltration. And I'm just me, so I don't think I'd be of much help."
 LAURA: Do you have healing potions?
 MATT: "Actually, yes. Not many. We have a few left over. Horris should have a few more."
 LAURA: Just in case we get hurt or something.
 MATT: "I hope that isn't the case. Just in case, all right. I'll have those sent. I'll send them along with Ulog for you."
 LAURA: Thank you.
 MATT: "Of course."
 TRAVIS: Did you happen to draft up any of those Knights of Requital documents I asked for? Symbols?
 MATT: "Oh, yes." He pulls out a small piece of parchment and discretely hands it to you under the table. You feel it tap your knee. As you look inside, it's a symbol that looks like an R, but part of the R extends beyond to produce a K, almost. It looks like a sigil or seal that utilizes the title in it.
 TRAVIS: That's actually nice work.
 MARISHA: That is really nice. That's good.
 TRAVIS: I hate to burn it, though.
 MARISHA: You could do this, some graphic design.
 TALIESIN: Did you procure this for us?
 LAURA: He created them for us.
 TALIESIN: That's impressive.
 MATT: "I haven't used my art degree."
 (laughter)
 TALIESIN: Wow!
 TRAVIS: Got Dolan drawing it.
 MATT: "I have to ask you, because if we're all going in on this, I have to be absolutely sure. Are you coming with us on this? You can back out. There's no shame in that, but we're not going to go in this without your help as well. That would be foolish."
 TRAVIS: A moment for us to confer, if you don't mind.
 LIAM: We would like to discuss.
 MATT: He stands up for a second and says, "Ulog, drink?" "Sure." They both get up from the table and walk over to the bar to get another round.
 LAURA: I watch Ulog.
 TALIESIN: I can probably get one of them the way I did with Nott last night, if you like. Make sure we're not walking into anything we don't want to be.
 TRAVIS: I don't get that impression, do you?
 TALIESIN: No, I do not, but--
 TRAVIS: Maybe not just yet.
 TALIESIN: That's fine.
 TRAVIS: I like the offer, though.
 MARISHA: If anything, I feel bad. Feels like they're investing a lot of money on this play.
 TRAVIS: They'll get their return back if he's High-Richter afterwards, though.
 MARISHA: If he's High-Richter.
 TALIESIN: And if he's not, then they don't have to pay, because we obviously failed.
 TRAVIS: We're just being paid to empty the seat, not to put him in it.
 MARISHA: Correct. It would be super unfortunate to see someone else slide in there, other than him. But like you said, not our problem.
 TRAVIS: Nott, Caleb? I know you had reservations.
 TALIESIN: It's a good pay day.
 LIAM: I want to walk away very fast if this goes wrong. My hackles are up. It does not feel as sure a bet as other things that we have done together. But okay.
 SAM: If Caleb's in, I'm in.
 TRAVIS: We'll see what kind of plan we can come up with. We have a day.
 SAM: Yasha?
 TRAVIS: You hear thunder.
 TALIESIN: I respect this squarely, but if you really feel like this is turning, then we'll turn.
 LIAM: But there's money involved, so there's incentive.
 MARISHA: We have a little bit of time. We can still do a little bit of casing, maybe go talk to the Gentleman and see what he has to offer in between.
 TRAVIS: We have a day, right?
 MARISHA: Right? A day and a night?
 MATT: Yeah. You have the rest of the day, the evening, and tomorrow night is apparently the Pre-Harvest Gala in the Tri-Spire.
 TRAVIS: When we will strike! Jester, how do you feel?
 LAURA: I think it sounds fun! Sure, why not.
 TRAVIS: Oh! okay.
 SAM: Should we order up some puppies to celebrate? Just kidding.
 LAURA: I've never eaten a dog. I feel like I would feel really weird about it.
 SAM: Me neither.
 TRAVIS: We can call them back over.
 MATT: You see Dolan and Ulog are having their drink at the bar. They walk up and sit down. "So can we count on you?"
 LIAM: One hundred percent.
 TALIESIN: We're in.
 LAURA: The Fancybottom name is one can trust!
 MATT: You see Ulog and Dolan share a look and nod. A smile comes across Dolan's face. "Thank you. You won't regret it! I suppose, prepare whatever you'll need. We'll meet back in the cellar of The Leaky Tap tomorrow at sundown, and we'll take it from there." You can sense this excited nervousness to his voice that wasn't there before as he smiles.
 LAURA: Do you have a good way to get into the Tri-Spire?
 MATT: "We have a few ideas."
 LAURA: Okay.
 MATT: "Til tomorrow, then!"
 TRAVIS: Til tomorrow.
 MATT: He gets up and finishes his drink and buttons the top button of his shirt, and then makes his way out. Ulog sits up, goes and takes what swills at the bottom of Dolan's drink and finishes it, then finishes his drink, pops it down. "Til tomorrow." He gets up and leaves.
 TALIESIN: Has anyone been watching us?
 MATT: Perception check.
 LIAM: He is hard to read.
 TALIESIN: That's an eight.
 LIAM: Level three, motherfucker.
 MATT: You don't notice anybody paying attention.
 LAURA: I feel like I would've been looking, too, because I was watching for people at the beginning of that.
 MATT: The only thing you notice is that on the way out, Dolan -- As he heads to the door, you see Kara, the half-elf, was waiting at the door. As soon as he heads over, she goes, "So?" They both exit into the main thoroughfare.
 TRAVIS: I actually like what Molly said. I feel like tomorrow night, before we go, you should do your thing on Ulog.
 LAURA: I also have a spell that can make people tell the truth.
 TRAVIS: That would work great. I think they'd understand, too. If we did it too early, I think they-- cause you to cause suspicion. After all, we’re only trying to make sure that this isn’t a trap. That’s it for us.
 LIAM: Which is possible.
 TRAVIS: Make you feel better, if we had the answer.
 LIAM: Yeah. Most likely.
 TRAVIS: What do we do this evening to prepare?
 SAM: Get drunk?
 TRAVIS: Well, I was thinking more along the lines of checking out Lord Sutan.
 SAM: Okay.
 MARISHA: We got to go back to the Tri-Spire? Which we can do.
 LAURA: Or, no, we can just go to the hall of the Hall of Justice.
 (laughter)
 LIAM: Meanwhile, at the Soltryce Academy.
 SAM and LAURA: The King’s Hall?
 MARISHA: Is that where Lord Sutan is?
 MATT: You don’t know much about Lord Sutan. You haven’t heard his name referenced at all with any of the--
 TRAVIS: They just left and we forgot to ask where the *fuck* he is! Twice! Can we run out after them?
 MARISHA and TRAVIS: Wait wait wait!
 MATT: Make a perception check.
 TRAVIS: Oh god. Oh! 15.
 MATT: 15? You glance through the crowd, and you can just make out, it the distance, the back of Ulog as he’s walking down the street, about to turn.
 TRAVIS: One sec. (panting)
 MATT: As you catch up, he glances over his shoulder at the sound of the running, and he goes, “What?”
 TRAVIS: You dropped this money. (whispering) Where do we find Lord Sutan?
 MATT: “I don’t fucking know. His estate? He’s not that far from where the gala’s happening.”
 TRAVIS: Just take it and say thank you! (whispering) Okay, don’t worry about it. (panting) They don’t know.
 LAURA: But the Tri-Spire.
 TRAVIS: Yeah.
 MATT: He knows where he lives, that’s it.
 TRAVIS: They know where he lives.
 MARISHA: In the Tri-Spire?
 TRAVIS: In the Tri-Spire.
 LIAM: So it’s another dance through the sewer if we want to do that tonight, which we could do.
 TRAVIS: Yeah. Maybe that guard got his job back.
 MARISHA: He respawned.
 LIAM: Yeah, I think that ship has sailed, Fjord.
 TRAVIS: I’m sure he’s fine.
 MARISHA: Okay, well at dawn, we plan?
 LAURA: Yeah.
 TRAVIS: Well, we got to figure out where the Lord Sutan’s estate is, get a wax seal, a writing, forge his hand.
 LAURA: We’re going to do all that during the gala?
 SAM: Yeah.
 MATT: That’s all, supposedly, in one night.
 TRAVIS: Yeah, at dawn, we plan.
 MARISHA: At dawn, we plan.
 MATT: At dawn, we plan. And that’s where we’ll pick up next week. Building up to--
 SAM: There’s so much build up.
 MATT: I know. DandD, motherfucker. So we’ll see where this takes you guys next week, during the Pre-Harvest Gala.
 MARISHA: I think we’re going to have to reignite our planning thread.
 TRAVIS: Yep!
 MARISHA: It’s time!
 LIAM: Come up with one.
 MARISHA: Yeah. Dust the cobwebs off of it.
 LIAM: Actually come up with one.
 MARISHA: It’s good. We’re going to go full Ocean’s Nein, you guys!
 TRAVIS: We got Pumat Sol back, man! We need Pumat every once and awhile.
 MATT: You brought back Pumat, you bought DandD smut.
 TRAVIS: That’s right!
 MARISHA: And bear claws.
 MATT: There you go! Bought some bear claws.
 TALIESIN: I got a nifty necklace.
 MATT: You did.
 TALIESIN: It does cool things on DandD-- when I put it on my character, it did really cool things. It got a little picture.
 MATT: Oh, that’s cool!
 TALIESIN: On DandD Beyond. That’s nice.
 MATT: Awesome. Well, we’ll pick up for the ensuing tension next week on Thursday. This weekend, we’ll see you guys who are planning to come down to WonderCon for our panel, 11:30 in the morning, on Sunday. Hopefully we’ll see you guys there. Until then, have a wonderful night, and is it Thursday yet? Good night.
